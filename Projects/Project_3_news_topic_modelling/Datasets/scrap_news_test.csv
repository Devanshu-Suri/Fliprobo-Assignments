Let’s just say that after the minimalist, white scheme of the latest digital stores, Amit Aggarwal’s e-commerce platform, with its dark grey background, is refreshing. It offers just the right contrast to the strong metallic colours of his outfits — often bottle green, gold and silver. 






From Amit Aggarwal’s couture collection  






The Luxury Pret line begins with sheer, asymmetric shirts at ₹16,500 and his signature structured capes at ₹19,500. Couture starts at ₹42,500 for unstitched saris paired with metallic bustiers, moulded 3D hand-embroidered or lace blouses. The collections go all the way up to ₹5.25 lakh for elaborately-embroidered structured lehengas — customisation details can be submitted in an online form or shared on WhatsApp. This goes beyond the lining, coverage and length options offered by other designers (like Gaurav Gupta, who launched his digital store recently). For those not bound by a budget, AA Exclusives features winged gowns, 3D skater dresses, and pre-stitched saris. This price-on-request section, unfortunately, has no descriptor or quick view for each garment. Users have to click and go into a new page to see each piece while browsing. 






Designer Amit Aggarwal
 






That said, the site is easy to navigate, with tabs that introduce customers to the designer and brand, as well as a prominent press section. Aggarwal’s film from the recently-concluded India Couture Week is hosted on the home page.Up next: AM.IT, Aggarwal’s ready-to-wear collection. The diffusion line, launched in 2015, was created to “ensure natural and manmade textiles co-exist” and features handloom fabric from across the country.

 The CAG has found that the Union government in the very first two years of the GST implementation wrongly retained ₹47,272 crore of GST compensation cess that was meant to be used specifically to compensate states for loss of revenue. In its audit report of government accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) flagged that the amount was to be credited to the non-lapsable GST Compensation Cess collection fund for payment to states for loss of revenue due to implementation of GST since 2017, but the government did not do so, and thus violated the GST law.“The GST Compensation Cess Act, 2017 provides for levy of cess for the purpose of providing compensation to the states for loss of revenue arising due to implementation of GST for a period specified in the Act,” CAG said. As per the Act and the accounting procedure, the entire cess collected during the year is required to be credited to a non-lapsable Fund (the GST Compensation Cess Fund) which shall form part of the Public Account and shall be used for the purpose mentioned i.e., for providing compensation to states for loss of revenue.  CAG said out of the ₹62,612 crore GST Compensation Cess collected in 2017-18, ₹56,146 crore was transferred to the non-lapsable fund. In the following year (2018-19), ₹54,275 crore out of ₹95,081 crore collected was transferred to the fund. The short transfer in 2017-18 was ₹6,466 crore and in 2018-19 it was ₹40,806 crore, CAG said adding the Centre used this money for “other purposes” which “led to an overstatement of revenue receipts and understatement of fiscal deficit for the year.”The short-crediting was a violation of the GST Compensation Cess Act, 2017. The issue of compensation cess is driving a wedge between the Centre and states at the GST Council - the highest decision making body of the GST regime that had subsumed 17 different central and state taxes such as excise duty and VAT. States have not been paid their promised compensation for letting go their powers to levy taxes on goods and services since last fiscal. The Centre says a slowdown in the economy has meant that not enough money is being collected by way of cess that is levied on luxury and sin goods. The Centre has asked states to borrow for meeting the revenue shortfall. States ruled by Congress, Left, TMC and AAP have opposed the move completely arguing that the Centre should borrow and provide to states, since states have given majority of their taxation powers to the Centre under GST regime introduced in July 2017. The CAG findings run contrary to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s submissions in Parliament last week that states could not be compensated for revenue shortfall from the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) relying on an opinion from the Attorney General of India which stated that there was no such provision in the law.“Audit examination of information in Statements 8, 9 and 13 with regard to the collection of the cess and its transfer to the GST Compensation Cess Fund, shows that there was short crediting to the Fund of the GST Compensation Cess collections totalling to ₹47,272 crore during 2017-18 and 2018-19,” CAG said in the audit report.The short-crediting, CAG said, was a violation of the GST Compensation Cess Act, 2017.“The amount by which the cess was short credited was also retained in the CFI and became available for use for purposes other than what was provided in the Act,” it said. According to CAG, the Finance Ministry accepted the audit observation and stated in February 2020 that the proceeds of cess collected and not transferred to Public Account would be transferred in the subsequent year.“Short crediting of cess collected during the year led to an overstatement of revenue receipts and understatement of fiscal deficit for the year,” CAG said. Further, any transfer in the subsequent year would become an appropriation from the resources of that year and would require Parliamentary authorisation, it said asking the Finance Ministry to take immediate corrective action.  As per the approved accounting procedure, GST Compensation cess was to be transferred to the Public Account by debit to Major Head ‘2047-Other fiscal services’ Instead, the Ministry of Finance operated the Major Head ‘3601-Transfer of Grants in aid to States’ “The wrongful operation has implications on the reporting of Grants in aid since the GST Compensation Cess is the right of the states and is not a Grant in aid,” CAG said. The GST (Compensation to States) Act guarantees all states an annual growth rate of 14 per cent in their GST revenue in the first five years of implementation of GST beginning July 2017. It was introduced as a relief for states for the loss of revenues arising from the implementation of GST. If a state’s revenue grows slower than 14 per cent, it is supposed to be compensated by the Centre using the funds specifically collected as compensation cess. To provide these grants, a GST compensation cess is levied on certain luxury and sin goods. The collected compensation cess flows into the CFI, and is then transferred to the Public Account of India, where a GST compensation cess account has been created. States are compensated bi-monthly from the accumulated funds in this account. However, instead of transferring the entire GST cess amount to the GST compensation fund, the CAG found that the Centre retained these funds in the CFI and used it for other purposes.

 Vodafone Group Plc has won an international arbitration case against the Indian government in a ₹14,200 crore retrospective tax dispute, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.The tribunal ruled that the Indian government's imposition of a tax liability on Vodafone is in breach of the investment treaty agreement between India and the Netherlands, one of the sources said. The British telecom giant moved the Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2016. Vodafone in 2013 had invoked India-Netherlands bilateral investment treaty seeking resolution to the tax demand imposed on it by enacting a tax law with retrospective effect to sidestep a Supreme Court judgement that went in the company’s favour.Conciliatory proceedings were initiated to resolve the dispute but differences led to a breakdown following which arbitration was initiated.The government had initially slapped a tax demand of ₹7,990 crore on Vodafone for failing to deduct tax on capital gains made over its $11-billion acquisition of 67% stake in the mobile phone business owned by Hutchison Whampoa in 2007.

Maduravoyal police have arrested a gang of three who allegedly obtained vehicle loans based on papers submitted by a customer who bought a mobile phone from a showroom, through a payment of monthly instalments. The suspects have been identified as S. Rajesh, 31 of Maduravoyal, M. Vignesh, 23 of Vanagaram and G. Lokesh 31 of Thiruverkadu. They were arrested by police following a complaint from P. Rajesh, 28 who is a medical representative and staying in T. Nagar. The complainant visited a showroom of a leading mobile phone dealer in Porur and bought a mobile, paying on a monthly instalment basis. He also produced all his documents for availing of the loan. After a couple of months, he was shocked on receipt of an SMS informing him of an unauthorised deduction from his account and on enquiry with the bank, he learnt that the amount was deducted towards repayment of loan for buying a vehicle from a dealer in Maduravoyal. He had never availed of such a loan. He complained to the Maduravoyal police. Maduravoyal police, with the help of the cyber crime cell in Anna Nagar, traced the suspects. The suspect Vignesh who was working as a loan consultant in the mobile phone showroom and used documents produced by the mobile phone buyer and raised four or five vehicle loans on producing those documents, at different dealers. The other two suspects -- Rajesh and Lokesh abetted the crime. They also sold off the vehicles at cheap rates and profited. The trio had committed similar frauds in a few other places based on documents produced by genuine loan aspirants, the police said.

DNA samples of the three youths killed in a joint operation of the Army and the police in Shopian on July 18 matched the samples taken from the three families of missing youth from Rajouri, the police said on Friday.“DNA sample results of the three families of Rajouri have matched those killed in Amshipora of Shopian. We will now take further course of action and complete the remaining formalities,” Inspector General of Police Vijay Kumar said at a press conference in Srinagar.It took the police around 40 days to match the DNA samples of the families with the slain youth, described as “unidentified terrorists” earlier. The Rajouri families, however, disputed the claims of the security forces and asserted that they were labourers and on the way home from the Shopian route.On September 18, the Army’s inquiry also established that the Shopian operation contravened the dos and don’ts of the Chief of Army Staff approved by the Supreme Court and exceeded the powers vested under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).The Army has initiated disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima facie answerable.Advocate Qadri killers posed as clientsMr. Kumar said known TV analyst and lawyer Babar Qadri, 39, was killed by two pistol- borne men posing as his clients with files.“A special investigation team has been constituted to probe the incident.

CPI (M) Politburo member and All India Kisan Sabha national vice president S. Ramachandran Pillai on Friday called for a united effort at the national level to resist the anti-democratic and anti-farmer policies of the BJP Government.“The controversial farm bills introduced by the Centre abysmally fall short legally and constitutionally. They will practically hand over the vulnerable agriculture sector to Indian and foreign corporates,” Mr. Ramachandran Pillai said, inaugurating a protest sit-in outside the Raj Bhavan organised by the Samyuktha Karshaka Samithi as part of the nationwide stir against the bills.

 “The decision to promote contract farming, for instance, will estrange farmers from farm lands and the markets. Farmers will be relegated to the position of corporate labourers,” he said.“In its hurried effort to get the Bills cleared by the Parliament, the BJP Government has disregarded Parliamentary procedures and attempted to use powers which, in reality, it does not possess,” Mr. Pillai said. “The Centre is attempting to impose its anti-people, neoliberal policies on the nation under the cover of the Coronavirus pandemic,” he alleged.Though the Centre paints the bills as solutions to the problems plaguing the sector, it has, in reality, declined to introduce measures which would address such issues. “It is true that there is a crisis in the sector and that it is growing. Majority of the farmers do not find farming a profitable venture today. Agricultural costs have risen. But the flawed policies of the Government are responsible for the crisis,” he said.Mr. Pillai drew attention to the M.S. Swaminathan committee recommendation that the MSP should be fixed at 50% more than the weighted average of the production cost. “But the Centre has declined to implement it,” he said. “No steps have been taken to increase productivity or ensure a fair price to farmers. These are the steps necessary to protect them,” he said.Protests were organised under the aegis of the Samyuktha Karshaka Samithi in more than 250 centres in the State on Friday as part of the nationwide stir against the controversial farm bills introduced by the Centre.Samyuktha Karshaka Samithi chairman Sathyan Mokeri presided over the Raj Bhavan protest.

Life changed for the better for 17-year-old Dhanush Kumar, a class 12 student at the Hindu High School, when his father, a fisherman, asked him to enrol at the SUP-Marina Club, which offers free Stand Up Paddle (SUP) training for youngsters from the fishing community. Now, the Greater Chennai Police have come forward to support youngsters like Dhanush.“My father did not want me to fall into bad company and pick up bad habits. He wanted me to take up water sports, as I am from the fishing community. Now my concentration, energy and health have all improved. I have an aim in life -- to become a police officer,” said Dhanush.To help children like Dhanush steer clear of bad habits and use their energy in developing skills, R. Sudhakar, Joint Commissioner of Police, East Zone on Thursday gifted a Stand Up Paddle (SUP) - Surf Board to the SUP Marina Club that offers free training to children from the fisher community.The club is being run by 46-year-old A. Satish Kumar for the past three years. “I was interested in surfing earlier, and then I took up SUP. I felt that our shorelines are not explored properly,” he said.Mr. Satish said that there are many talented persons, especially in water sports, in the fisher community. “They have no opportunity to showcase their skills. The only sporting event they hold is either swimming or catamaran race. Hence, I started this club so that the energy of the children is channelised effectively,” he said.There are over 25 members in his club and they are aged between 7 to 30 years. “Many of them have taken part in rallies and are being trained to take part in national competitions. The SUP-Surf paddle will help the youngsters do surfing and paddling,” added Mr. Satish, whose club is located in Chepauk.G. Dharmarajan, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Triplicane, said that this was part of community policing. “This is an attempt to channelise the energy of the youth. Sports is an excellent medium for this,” he said.

The Supreme Court on Friday refused to pass an interim order in a challenge against a Madras High Court decision to set up a committee to “finalise” OBC reservation in State-surrendered seats for the All India Quota in non-central medical colleges.“There is no interim order. We will hear this case early”, Justice L. Nageswara Rao, heading a three-judge Bench, said.The court scheduled the case for hearing on October 13.It was responding to a submission by senior advocate V. Giri, for Tamil Nadu, for an interim order. He said the High Court had “accepted our contentions to a large extent”.MCI stand Advocate Gaurav Sharma, for the Medical Council of India (MCI), said they had nothing to say on the issue of reservation. “It is the government which has to say anything on it”, he submitted. The MCI would abide by the government’s decision.Senior advocate P. Wilson submitted that a committee had been formed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on September 7. A meeting was held on September 22.“The Health Minister has said to a question raised in Parliament that State-specific reservation will be followed. I will place it on record”, Mr. Wilson, who is also a DMK Rajya Sabha member, submitted.Advocate Balaji Srinivasan appeared for the AIADMK and sought an early hearing.On August 14, the court issued notice to the respondents, including the Centre and the MCI. The Tamil Nadu government had said the High Court declined to straightaway order the Centre and the MCI to implement 50% reservation for Backward Classes, Most Backward Classes and Denotified Community in these seats in undergraduate, postgraduate and diploma medical and dental courses in compliance with reservation rules followed in the State for the academic year 2020-21. The High Court, in its decision on July 27, declined the mandamus “despite finding there is a clear substantive law providing for State-specific reservation formulated by the MCI”.The petition has said, “Instead, the court set up a committee, when such a committee was unnecessary, consisting of the Directorate General of Health Services, the MCI and the Tamil Nadu government department concerned to 'finalise the manner in which the facilities of OBC reservation are to be provided’.”‘Self-contradictory’The State said the High Court was self-contradictory.“Once the court has determinatively found that the governing law provides for OBC reservation as per Tamil Nadu rules, then the proverbial ‘story’ ends there and the appropriate authorities ought to be directed to apply the law. The committee, therefore, is aimless and entirely redundant”, the State has argued.It said the High Court had further excluded OBC reservation for the current academic year – despite finding that there was a legal right. This had denied a number of deserving OBC candidates seats in the All India Quota for 2020-2021.

It catches you unawares. There’s the Kolkata you have always known, with its rows of hideous highrises, the red-painted buildings from an older era, the Howrah Bridge, the blue-white railings, the mesh of overhead wires blocking the sky. If they all look battered and crumbling, well, that is how Kolkata is. Then you realise with a start that the rot has gone deeper than ever before — the roads are under putrid green water, the trams are ghost ships disintegrating in sheds, the railway platforms are submerged and the last trains have left, never to return. Crows circle over this wasteland, cawing menacingly, a crocodile slips under the scum at the erstwhile Gariahat crossing, snakes slither, catfish swim. This is the Kolkata of the future as imagined by the short animation film, Wade. Climate change has returned the city to the swamps it was reclaimed from and the well-heeled have fled to drier grounds.Atmosphere of menaceThe people left behind are a straggly set of migrants from the Sundarbans, which is now a few scattered islands floating like dead leaves in a ravenous sea. Rising sea levels have displaced not just the human inhabitants but also animals. In Wade, a terrifying encounter takes place between two groups of climate change migrants — humans and tigers — in a ravaged Park Street. The wide-eyed humans and animals, the background score of swamp sounds mixed with a grating metallic roar, the absence of dialogues, and the visuals of a broken city create an atmosphere of menace, which is compounded by the realisation that this might not just be a dystopic vision after all. Around 17 million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2018; and, according to a World Bank study, 143 million people could be rendered homeless by climate change-related catastrophes by 2050 in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and South Asia. The Ghoramara island in the Sundarbans is sinking steadily as a result of climate change. If global temperatures continue to rise at the current rate, coastal cities like Kolkata might well be under water in 30 years’ time. Wade is the creation of Ghost Animation, a collective of young animators, artists and filmmakers from all over India, based in Kolkata. Their signature style is 2D animation, drawn by hand, frame by frame.“Every frame is a unique drawing made from scratch, and we love the flavour that brings to the story,”say Upamanyu Bhattacharyya and Kalp Sanghvi, who make up the team along withGaurav Wakankar, Isha Mangalmurti, Shaheen Sheriff and Anwaar Alam. These days, one usually doesn’t associate Kolkata with skilled young professionals. But, Sanghvi says, “Kolkata has been very good for us, and we’ve had no trouble bringing some very good talent to the city to work with us.” Shell of Park StreetTheir closeness to Kolkata is apparent in Wade: the visuals will move any viewer but will probably leave a Kolkatan devastated. The film has that effect because it recreates the city not just through the recognisable Howrah Bridge or Victoria Memorial but also through smaller details like the pamphlet-plastered electricity boxes on South Kolkata roads, the ubiquitous graffiti, the blue mosaic on a Metro station wall. This familiarity lends plausibility to the unfamiliar future, making it scarier. For instance, Park Street, where the main action takes place, still retains the pink Flurys banner, the Stephen Court building, the McDonald’s logo. Explaining why they chose to set the action in Park Street, Bhattacharyya says, “Because it’s recognisable and because most people of a certain level of privilege have had good times there. We felt that all the decadence and luxuries that Park Street embodies are surviving on borrowed time, and soon it’ll be a shell,” adding, “People who have seen the future of Park Street as depicted in Wade have described it as akin to ‘watching a good friend suffer.’”Ghost Animation films usually tend to be more about ordinary people. In a West Bengal tourism film, toddy-tappers atop palm trees and the Darjeeling toy train make up dazzling kaleidoscopic patterns, accompanied by footages of the Maidan football players and schoolgirls balancing themselves on railway tracks. In Wade, the landed rich have vanished altogether, leaving the migrants to fight it out in a space still echoing with the revelry of heedless days. Us vs. themWall graffiti declaring ‘Send back! Save Kolkata from climate change refugees’ speaks of a time when city dwellers had closed ranks to keep out the newly-arrived. “Society is not accepting of people fleeing situations of distress. Today, our borders are more rigid and we have a sharper sense of ‘us vs. them’ than ever before,” says Sanghvi. The ‘them’ include the fauna, the most powerless of them all: Ghost Animation’s short film, Kinara — The Edge, made for the Wildlife Trust of India, also featuring tigers, is a chilling story of how humans evict animals from their own hunting grounds and kill them when they return looking for food.Expectedly, Wade is getting a lot of attention internationally, having been selected at nearly 40 global festivals, including the 2020 Annecy International Animated Film Festival (held in June), where it won the City of Annecy Award. The story of Wade continues to grow: the team is currently working on an anthology of comic short stories further exploring the Wade universe, delving into how people ignored the climate crisis while the city still looked ‘normal’ and how life gradually changed for the worse. Ominous? Yes, but it might just wake us up.anusua.m@thehindu.co.in

“Despite opposition by the people and their representatives in Rajya Sabha, the government went ahead and made the new laws. The government is not listening even to the people. Who are they making laws for? They take money from big corporates as donation for elections and make laws to suit them,” said Mr. Charuni.Meanwhile, the call for Bharat bandh evoked mixed response in Haryana with few instances of road blockade in Kurukshetra. Though commercial establishments and transport was not affected in the state, the grains markets wore a deserted look in a few districts. “The business today (on Friday) is almost nil. Around 15,000 sacks of paddy were sold on Thursday, but only a couple of farmers turned up today. Both farmers and arthiyas have supported the Bharat bandh call,” said Sandeep Beniwal, commission agent, Samalkha New Grains Market off National Highway-44 in Haryana's Panipat.Besides, peaceful protests were held in Jind, Kaithal, Ambala and Yamuna Nagar districts as well.

Gurpreet was elected as the winner on the basis of votes from Indian Super League and I-League club coaches.“There was always a desire to reach this point and this is an award which I have always looked up to. Chhetri-bhai (Sunil Chhetri) has won it so many times and I have always thought when I can be worthy enough to win it,” Gurpreet said.“Huge thanks go to AIFF and everyone who has supported and helped me relentlessly to help me achieve this today.”  “Garnering the all-important draw against Asian Champions Qatar in Doha, eleven clean sheets in last Indian Super League edition, winning the Golden Glove award could not have been possible without the team,” he added.The 28-year-old had also received the Arjuna Award last year. Meanwhile, national women’s team mid-fielder Sanju was selected the winner after an excellent season. Ratanbala Devi won the 2019-20 Emerging Women’s Footballer of the Year Award. Both the winners were selected by head coach Maymol Rocky in consultation with AIFF technical director Isac Doru. Sanju said, “Personally, it’s a big milestone for me. This award is the proof that all the hard work that we have been doing over the last few years has indeed paid off.“I would like to thank AIFF for all the exposure that we have got to grow and to improve ourselves. I’d also like to thank the seniors in our team. All of them have been an immense help to me and have helped me cope with the rigours of international football.“I’d also like to thank Maymol ma’am for allowing me the time and the opportunity to grow within the team and express myself on the pitch.” Mid-fielder Anirudh Thapa was named the Men’s Emerging Footballer of the Year. He was also selected on the basis of votes from ISL and Hero I-League club coaches. The award for the best referee was won by L. Ajit Kumar Meetei from Manipur, while P. Vairamuthu from Tamil Nadu was named the best assistant referee.

 Normal life was hit in Punjab on Friday amid the call for a nationwide shutdown — Bharat bandh — by several farmer outfits against the agriculture sector laws pushed by the Centre government.Hundreds of farmers were seen in Patiala district’s Rajpura, where they squatted on the road at the Patiala bypass on the national highway.They were shouting slogans against the BJP-led government at the Centre, accusing it of implementing “anti-farmer” policies.Participating in the agitation, Gurdev Singh, 60, a farmer from Bhamour village in Fatehgarh Sahib, said his greatest fear was that private players would take over agriculture trade completely and government would stop purchasing wheat and paddy subsequently.“Once the government stops purchasing wheat and paddy, it’s evident that Minimum Support Price regime will get discard. Where will a small farmer like me go then? It’s a conspiracy to phase out farmers from agriculture and let big corporates take over gradually,” said Mr. Singh, who owns five acres of land and has cultivated paddy in his farm.Shops and commercial establishments remained closed in most parts of the State. As several group of farmers held sit-in (dharnas) on key roads, including national and State highways, besides railway tracks at few places, vehicular and rail traffic movement was severely disrupted. Agitating farmers blocked roads in Patiala, Moga, Ferozepur, Fazilka, Barnala, Faridkot, Muktsar, Mansa, Bathinda and other districts.As many as 31 farmer outfits based in Punjab have called for a complete shutdown. They have also announced they would stop railway traffic indefinitely from October 1, if demands were not fulfilled.Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), an umbrella body of over 250 farmer and farm-worker organisations, is among those that have given the call for nationwide shutdown.The ruling Congress and the BJP’s alliance partner Shiromani Akali Dal have also extended support to the shutdown. Akali Dal has announced a State-wide chakka-jam (blocking roads). The party is observing a three-hour programme from 11 am to 1 pm.

The diverted funds were used by the accused to acquire more than 160 immovable/movable assets in his name and that of his family members and the entities owned by him. Some properties have already been disposed of.The ED is pursuing the money laundering probe on a complaint from the Office of the Registrar Cooperative Societies, Bengaluru, and the FIRs registered at the Basaveshwara police station in Bengaluru City against Mr. Nanjundaiah, SKSCCL and others. The funds were collected through commission agents, without maintaining the required liquidity, as alleged.“The accused advanced loans out of the deposits without getting any security, against the existing rules and regulations,” said an official.Premises searchedThe ED had conducted searches on the premises of Mr. Nanjundaiah and other directors of the SKSCCL and the Kanva Group.

In a suspected case of honour killing, a 26-year-old interior designer was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by his wife’s family members on Thursday evening at Kistaiahguda of Sangareddy district.The youngster, Hemnath, was in a relationship with Avanthi Reddy, 23, an engineering graduate, for about eight years, and the couple got married at Sub-Registrar officer, Quthbullapur, on June 11 this year, against the wish of her family members.After their marriage, Hemanth and Avanti were living in a rented house at TNGO’s Colony, Gachibowli. Their parents live in Chandanagar.On Thursday, Avanthi’s parents, Laxma Reddy and Archana Reddy, along with her maternal uncles Vijayender Reddy, Yugandhar Reddy and other family members, came to the couple’s house for talks. “Around 2.30, Hemanth phoned his parents informing them about the sudden visit of her relatives and asked them to come to his house at the earliest,” Madhapur in-charge DCP M Venkateshwarlu told The Hindu.By the time Hemanth’s parents Murali and Laxmi Rani reached TNGO’s Colony, they had forced the young couple into a car saying that they were being taken to Avanthi’s parents’ house at Chandanagar, the officer said.Murali and his wife saw the cars, alerted police and followed their trail.“When the car headed towards Outer Ring Road, the young couple managed to jump out of the moving car near Gopanpally Tanda crossroad. They started running barefoot. In the meantime, her uncle Yugandhar Reddy whisked away Hemanth in the car and took him towards Sangareddy,” Mr. Venkateshwarlu said.Soon, the police reached the spot and took the woman’s family members into custody. They registered a kidnapping case and launched a search operation for Hemanth. “Around 3.30 a.m. on Friday, Yugandhar Reddy, who was picked up from Shamirpet, told us that he, along with two others, tied Hemanth’s hand, throttled him to death and dumped the body near Kistaiahguda in Sangareddy,” the officer said.Based on his confession, teams were sent to the spot to identify and recover the body, which was later shifted to Osmania General Hospital morgue for autopsy.The victim’s mother Laxmi Rani alleged that Avanthi’s family members killed her son only because of ‘caste feeling’ and financial status.“Though we belong to an upper caste, we are not rich when compared with their (accused) family,” she said, while waiting for her son’s body at OGH morgue.She said that even after the marriage, Avanthi’s father used to call and threaten to kill her son. “We always thought he was angry with them as they got married against their will and the issue would pacify in a few months, but never imagined that he would really kill my son,” she said.“My father, uncles and other family members brutally killed my husband. I will never forgive them,” Ms. Avanthi said.She said that when they jumped out of the moving car, the passers-by did not bother to help her even though she was running and screaming on the road.“Everyone saw us, but no one reacted. They did not stop my uncle who was taking Hemanth in a car,” she said, adding that the police reached the spot only after 40 to 50 minutes from the time they reported the offence.Mr. Venkateshwarlu said that so far 13 people, including car driver Sahid Patel were taken into custody.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami will hold discussions with the Health and Family Welfare Department and the Revenue Department and make an announcement on the reopening of schools, said School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan at Gobichettipalayam on Friday. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, the School Education Department cannot take an independent decision on this, he said.Addressing media persons, he said that the Chief Minister will soon hold discussions with the three departments to analyse the COVID-19 situation in the State and take a decision on the reopening of schools. The Minister pointed out that a government order on Thursday, allowing students of Classes 10 to 12 to visit schools and get their doubts cleared was issued by the Revenue and Disaster Management Department.Students can on a voluntary basis, and after obtaining permission from their parents, students of these classes can visit their schools for getting their doubts cleared. “The Chief Minister will hold a discussion before October 1 during which the impact of COVID-19 will be discussed and a decision on reopening of schools will be taken”, he added.To a question on reducing the syllabus for the current academic year, Mr. Sengottaiyan said that a report was submitted to the CM who will decide whether to reduce the syllabus further or not. He said that admissions to schools will be closed by September 30 and if needed, the department will decide on extending the date for admissions.The Minister said that a helpline for students ‘14474’ will be launched next month where teachers will clarify the students’ doubts from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

Schools and colleges were shut down in the second week of March as a preventive measure to contain the spread of COVID-19. In September now, we are still debating whether to reopen. Apart from impacting the future of 32 crore young citizens, this has also pushed educators to reshape the mechanism of imparting lessons.Some immediate measures included shifting teaching process online on an untested and unprecedented scale, conducting online assessments on trial-and-error basis, creating content suitable for remote learning using technology and tools among others. However, transitioning to an ‘online mode’ has had its share of challenges. These include limited access to the Internet, lack of uninterrupted power supply, ill-equipped teachers, absence of a robust monitoring method, hindrances to replicating the rapport between teacher and students in an online world, bridging the patchy and impersonal online experience, increase in screen-time and unavailability of tools to create content in regional languages.The impact has been more severe for disadvantaged children leading to interrupted learning, compromised nutrition, childcare problems and consequent economic cost to families who cannot work. Another challenge is to ensure that students return and stay in school when schools reopen. This is especially true of protracted closures and when economic shocks place pressure on children to work and generate income for financially distressed families.As we find solutions to these challenges, we see glimpses of the future of learning. While educators and students are eager for institutions to open, the crisis has led to some elements of learning being changed permanently.The first is the increasing use of technology. During the lockdown, the government used the electronic media to ensure learning continuity for students. Some state governments have been working with media partners such as Doordarshan and All India Radio (AIR) to broadcast virtual classes and educational content through their regional channels. This is not only helping students in rural areas with no Internet connection but also visually impaired students. The boost to online learning has huge implications for our ability to scale and provide equitable access to millions of students. Educators, regulators and learners have to change their attitudes and accept that this will complement classroom learning.The second change will be in the increasing use of online tools and technology to enhance the learning experience. Great content is available for free online and can be used to learn from. The classroom can then become a forum for debate, discussion and a deeper delving into disciplines and promote collaboration and experiential learning. The third change will be personalisation of learning. Each student has his/her own pace of studying. While some may need more time others may need more material to achieve the same outcome. Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence coupled with strong data analytics can help customise individual learning paths at scale. The fourth will be in making learning equitable, convenient, lifelong and accessible. Many people, not necessarily students, have enrolled for new courses during the lockdown. The fact that you don’t need to travel or need to be in a classroom has democratised learning and made it convenient. Having said this, colleges and schools do much more than just deliver content and teach. The teachers’ ability to engage students in debate and discussion, to mentor and coach and to inspire and motivate is difficult to replicate in the online format. What is also difficult to replicate is peer learning, participation in extracurricular activities and sports, experiential learning and development of emotional quotient and leadership ability. While schools and colleges the way we know them are here to stay, the way learning happens and the way teachers teach is sure to change. The writers are founders and trustees of Plaksha University.

 al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), a globally-banned terror group, is now probably capable of only “small-scale regional attacks”, a top American counter-terrorism official has told lawmakers.AQIS was set up by al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in 2014 to expand the terror group’s influence in the region.In South Asia, al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) has struggled to rebound from the death of its leader, Asim Umar, in a U.S. military raid in Afghanistan in September 2019 and is probably only capable of small-scale regional attacks, Christopher Miller Director, National Counter-terrorism Center, told a Senate committee on Thursday. Testifying before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on the Threats to the Homeland, the top American counter-terrorism official said that in mid-March, AQIS published a special issue of Nawai Afghan Jihad praising the U.S.-Taliban agreement, which mirrored al-Qaeda’s leaders’ statements on the deal. Finally, al-Qaeda’s presence in Afghanistan has been reduced to a few dozen fighters who are primarily focused on their survival, and are probably incapable of conducting attacks outside the country under sustained CT pressure, Mr. Miller said. According to Mr. Miller, since the Global War on Terror began nearly two decades ago, the U.S. has significantly degraded terrorist adversaries and made the U.S. a considerably harder target for them to reach.“Today’s terrorism threat to the U.S. and our allies is less acute but more diffuse — emanating from more groups in more places than it did in 2001,” he said. While continued counter-terrorism pressure has degraded the group’s Afghanistan-Pakistan senior leadership, in the near term, al-Qaeda is more likely to focus on building its international affiliates and supporting small-scale, readily achievable attacks in key regions such as East and West Africa, said FBI Director Christopher Wray. Simultaneously, over the last year, propaganda from al-Qaeda leaders seeks to inspire individuals to conduct their own attacks in the U.S. and the West. For example, the December 2019 attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola demonstrates that groups such as al-Qaeda continue to be interested in encouraging attacks on the U.S. soil, he said.Mr. Miller told senators that 19 years ago, after the shock of al-Qaeda’s devastating attacks abated, the U.S. set out to accomplish three objectives; one, harden its borders; two, go overseas to destroy the safe havens and sanctuaries of al-Qaeda and its associated groups and attrit their combat forces; and three, address the drivers of instability that created al-Qaeda by supporting like-minded partners in their efforts to combat Islamist extremism.“Due to the enormous dedication, selfless service and sacrifice of hundreds of thousands of Americans and like-minded foreign partners, we have been remarkably successful in accomplishing the first two objectives.”“I sense that we are on the verge, if providence is kind, of transitioning from a U.S.-led, partner-enable campaign to an era where local and regional partners take the lead and we provide them niche support to fill gaps in their security, intelligence, informational and legal architectures,” he said.“I must be clear and not histrionic. Our enemies will successfully attack us again, as their adaptation and innovation are driven by a profound hatred for what we represent. This is our terrorists’ dilemma and their strategic advantage. They only need to be successful once while our defences must be successful all the time for preventing a cataclysmic attack. But our enemies have profoundly underestimated the resilience of the American people time and again,” Mr. Miller said.Mr. Miller wondered if the 9/11 al-Qaeda leaders regretted their decision to attack the U.S.“I’m confident the survivors must. They thought us soft, and spoiled and morally unanchored. They are now either dead, imprisoned or in hiding awaiting death or capture. Their ideology is debunked in the overwhelming majority of this Islamic world.”“No one today misjudges our resolve and commitment to protecting the security of our citizens and using all available instruments of national power against those that bring war and violence to our shores,” he added.

A Facebook tool that U.S. state election officials are using to monitor and report voting misinformation is offering only a limited view of Facebook activity and doesn’t include some of the major pathways for disinformation, according to a watchdog group’s report.Facebook reached out to state officials, encouraging them to use CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned social media metric tool to find voting misinformation in their states around the 2020 U.S. Presidential election.The tracking tool covers public Facebook groups and pages, but doesn’t include posts from most individual users or from private Facebook groups, except for a few verified profiles that includes politicians, celebrities and other high-profile people, according to a report by Tech Transparency Project (TTP).“When one state official pointed out that election disinformation is often spread by individual users and asked if that data could be added to the dashboard, a Facebook rep rejected the idea, saying it couldn’t because of privacy concerns,” the report said.Further, Facebook isn’t providing states with all the data they need to spot disinformation, such as voter suppression efforts, ahead of the November election, it added.A Facebook product executive had tweeted in July, “While some link posts get a lot of interactions, likes or comments, this content is a tiny % of what most people see on FB. News from these Pages don't represent the most viewed news stories on FB, either.”According to emails obtained by TPP, Facebook representatives have continued to push CrowdTangle with state election officials this year.The report further said that in March 2020, Jannelle Watson, another member of Facebook’s politics and government outreach team, wrote to Colorado’s director of elections stating “each state election authority will have their own CrowdTangle account” and offered additional trainings “to teach you how to leverage the full tool.”Facebook is putting a heavy emphasis on its work with state officials as it highlights its efforts to combat interference with the 2020 vote. CEO Mark Zuckerberg had said that Facebook is partnering with state election authorities to identify and remove false claims about polling conditions, adding the collaboration would continue through the election until we have a clear result.In addition to this, Facebook recently announced steps to combat election interference such as barring new political ads the week before Election Day, and removing posts from politicians that claim victory before official results are announced.But according to TTP, Facebook is both leaning on state officials to flag election disinformation and not giving those same officials the data they need to spot the full range of problematic content.Facebook has not responded to an emailed query at the time of publishing this story.

 SPB no more: Film industry, leaders pay tribute




 Popularly known as SPB, Balasubrahmanyam made his singing debut in 1966 with Telugu movie Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna. He has sung over 40,000 songs in as many as 16 languages including Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, and Hindi.Balasubrahmanyam was also a voice-over artist. He was the voice-over artist for actor Kamal Hassan, whenever the latter’s Tamil movies were dubbed in Telugu. Balasubrahmanyam also acted in a few movies.He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter — both are playback singers.Balasubrahmanyam sang thousands of songs in South Indian languages and in Hindi for five decades for generations of actors — from MGR, Sivaji Ganesan and Gemini Ganesan, down to the stars of the present — and is the winner of six national awards. He also had won the hearts of several fans across the world for whom his songs have marked milestones.

Political leaders condole S.P. Balasubrahmanyam's death




 ‘Paadum Nila’ (Singing Moon) as he was called by his fans had a lilting voice with the finest traces of great singers. “His was a breeze-like voice of A.M Raja, with the softness of the P.B. Srinivas and the effortlessness of Mohamed Rafi,” said film music historian Vamanan.His voice effortlessly captured varied human emotions and feelings. In one scene he would sing a spoof -- Annatha adurar othiko a laugh in his voice— and in another scene he would powerfully express the anguished mind by rendering -- Unna nenachan paatu padichen thangame as seen in Apoorva Sagodharargal. He had acted in films such as Manathil Uruthi Vendum, Keladi Kanmani and Sikaram, besides scoring music for some films.An extremely friendly and genial man who enjoyed his moments with interviewers, SPB once said he was fond of life and never wanted to die. Others in the industry had only the best words for him, considering him a friend and guide.First national awardSPB bagged his first national award for Sankarabharanam, even though all the songs in the Telugu film are based on pure Carnatic ragas. He was never formally trained in Carnatic music, but that did not stop him, not then, not ever. “Even SPB had apprehensions about taking on the assignment as he had no proper training in classical music. It was T.K. Pugazhlendi, the assistant of music director K.V. Mahadevan who persuaded SPB to render the songs,” said Mr. Vamanan. And what a hit they turned out to be.The second time he won the award, was for his first Hindi song, Tere Mere Beech Mein in the film Ek Duuje Ke Liye. Two more awards came his way for the Telugu films Sagarasangamam and Rudraveena. Sangeetha Sagara Ganayogi Panchakshara Gavai, the Kannada film won him the fifth national award.The award for Tamil films eluded him many years even though his collaboration with music directors Ilayaraja and M.S. Viswanathan had resulted in innumerable memorable duets, solos, folk songs, spoofs and songs with classical touches. He finally won it for the song Thanga Thamarai in the film Minsara Kanavu for which the music was scored by A.R. Rahman.SPB in an interview said Tamil films offered a lot of scenes and scope in which a song sat perfectly, without any artificiality.Born Sripathi Paditha Arathyula Balasubramaniam, in 1946, to Nellore-based Harikatha exponent Sambamurthy, SPB’s ambition was to become an engineer. His failure to clear a subject in his PUC course forced him to pursue the now-defunct AMIE course in Chennai. But the music in his blood lured him towards singing competitions, and finally to the film world.His talent was spotted by another playback singer and music director S.P. Kothandapani, who was sitting among the audience at a competition at the Andhra Social and Cultural Society (ASCA) and he provided him with an opportunity to sing in the Telugu film Sri Sri Mariatha Ramanna. SPB was one among the four singers — S.P. Kothandapani, P. Susheela, P.B. Srinivas and Eelapada Raguramaiha — who rendered the ragamalika song, Emi Evindha Mogum.“Anyone who had listened to the part he rendered for Shoban Babu would have realised the potential in the voice. It proved to be a prelude for a record career in film music,” said Mr. Vamanan. As they say, the rest was history.Break in Tamil film industryLooking back, even as he secured a toehold in the Telugu industry, a break in the Tamil film industry proved elusive until an introduction to music director M.S. Viswanthan (MSV) through his friend Bharani. SPB chose to render Nilava Ennidam Nerungathy before MSV, who liked the voice, but had reservations about his Tamil pronunciation. It was actually a chance meeting with MSV opened the doors of Tamil film music. SPB came in like a fresh breeze with Iyarkai Ennum Ilayakanni, for the film Santhi Nilayam.“Though the song was recorded first, another song, Aayiram Nilave Vaa in the MGR-starrer Adimaipen reached the public first -- the film was released earlier in the year 1969,” explained Mr. Vamanan.Both the songs became a hit overnight. SPB would gratefully acknowledge the opportunity given to him by MGR and music director K.V. Mahadevan who introduced him to the future Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.SPB was down with malaria after rehearsal was over. But MGR waited till he recovered. “MGR told me that he did not want to disappoint me. He felt that I would have informed my friends and if I was not given the opportunity, my friends would not think well of my capacity as a singer,” SPB once said.Later in the film Suryakanthi, he sang the number Naan Endral Avalum Naanum and late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa rendered the English verses. His playback songs for thespian Sivaji Ganesan, particularly Pootuvaitha Mugamo in Sumathi En Sundari and Emuna Nadhi Inkey in Gowravam were equally popular.Even though there is the argument that MGR had roped in SPB because of his difference of opinion with T.M. Soundararajan (TMS), Mr. Vamanan said MGR continued to prefer TMS to render duets and songs with political messages. MGR also gave opportunities to K.J. Jesudas and Jayachandran.SPB sang Aval Oru Navarasa Natakam in the film Ulagam Suttrum Vaaliban and Paadum Pothu Naan Thendral Kattru and Angey Varuvathu Yaro in the film Netru Indru Naalai. MSV continued to use SPB in films of all actors.Even though he worked with other music directors like V. Kumar, Vijaybaskar and Shyam, SPB’s career graph ascended with the arrival of Ilayaraja and actors such as Rajinikant and Kamal Haasan.Even with Ilayaraja it did not happen immediately. SPB could not get an opportunity in Annakili, Patrakalai, Kavikuyil, Durgadevi, Deepam and Thunai Iruppal Meenakshi. Once the combination began though, it proved unstoppable. Bhuvana Oru Kelvikuri offered him two outstanding songs — Raja Enbar Mandhiri Enbar and Vizhiyile Malarnthathu. The duets he rendered with S. Janaki were irreplaceable.At a time when Ilayaraja started dominating film music, MSV’s music for Ninaithale Inikkum rocked and almost all the songs were rendered by SPB in the film. Later when MSV and Ilayaraja came together to score music for Mella Thiranthathu Kathavu, SPB was their natural choice.Actor Mohan benefited enormously from the music of Ilayaraja and voice of SPB. Almost all the songs in his films proved great numbers. His voice remained eternally youthful and he enthralled his fans by appearing on stage with light music troupes.He and Ilayaraja had a small falling out after the music director prevented him from singing on stage the songs composed by him, based on copyright claims. The two patched up though later, in a public event.SPB was the favourite singer of MSV and would always cherish the song Ilakkanam Marudho in the film Nizhal Nijamahirathu.When MSV composed music for Krishna Ganangal penned by Kannadasan, SPB sang the song, the lullaby Ayarpadi Maligaiyil Thaimadiyil Kantrinaipol Mayakannan Thoongukiran. And now, SPB himself will be asleep forever, his voice playing the same lullaby it has played in several homes for decades now.SPB is no more, but his voice will live on.

 Sushant Singh Rajput’s family lawyer Vikas Singh claimed on Friday that a doctor, who is part of AIIMS team, had told him “long back” that Rajput’s photos sent by the lawyer indicated that it was allegedly death by strangulation, not suicide. The senior advocate took to Twitter saying he was getting “frustrated” by the delay in CBI taking a decision in the case.“Getting frustrated by the delay in CBI taking a decision to convert abetment to suicide to Murder of SSR (Sushant Singh Rajput).“The Doctor who is part of AIIMS team had told me long back that the photos sent by me indicated 200% that it’s death by strangulation and not suicide,” Mr. Singh tweeted. Rajput, 34, was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14 following which the Mumbai Police had lodged an Accidental Death Report (ADR). On July 25, Rajput’s father K.K.

We may have been confined us to our homes these past few months and if you haven’t already, it’s time you redo your only slice of outdoors — the balcony or terrace — to get your share of sunshine. Most times, the balcony, patio or terrace turns into the most neglected area of our home. But it can be the place where you have your first cup of coffee at sunrise or relax with a book at sundown. Kit out your open space to make your time there much more enjoyable. 1. A table to begin withBe it a coffee table or a side table that’s functioning as your central furniture fixture, look for a piece that is just right in scale. Too big a piece may mean you can’t fit much of anything else in the verandah. If you don’t want a large table, consider using an ottoman — one with storage. 







2. Get the seating rightWouldn’t you like to put your legs up as you read the latest bestseller or peruse the morning papers along with hot cup of coffee? Ensure that there’s always somewhere comfortable to sit by getting a couple of options — a bench, a single seater and a rattan piece may be? 







3. Swing in a hammockAdd an element that will put you in a holiday mood every time you enter your verandah. A smart hammock that invites you to laze and linger — along with a book or your thoughts — is just the thing you need to invest in. 







4. If there’s no breeze, create itIt’s going to be breezy some nights if you’re lucky, but it’s sure to be hot on most of them. Stay immune to heat — well almost! — by installing a swinging wall fan that showers you with the breeze you need every minute. 5. Let there be soft lightThere’s something about soft candlelight. It creates a mellow inviting atmosphere that seems to rid a space of all problems in a jiffy. Pop a couple of candles in candle holders and light up when you have guests over; they’ll gravitate out of doors naturally. 






Apart from these five tips, there are many other ways to enhance the aesthetic of your open space: bring in cheerful decals, string up a bunting, grow a mini garden, or display some cheap ceramic plates. Sky is the limit so get started and liven up your home this weekend.

 Hitting out at the Opposition at its attack on his government over the farm bills issue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that those who always “lied” to farmers are now “shooting from their shoulders” and misleading them for their own political benefit. Addressing BJP leaders and workers on the birth anniversary of party’s ideologue Deendayal Upadhyay, Modi asked them to reach out to farmers on the ground and inform them about details and benefits of the new agriculture reforms and how these will empower them. Our ground connect will finish off the propaganda being spread about the reforms, he said. Mr. Modi said small and marginal farmers, who constitute 85% of the peasant community, will benefit the most from these reforms which, he added, give them an option to sell their produce outside agriculture ‘mandis’ for a better price. Explained: Why are the Agriculture Bills being opposedAttacking the Congress, which has been trying to mount a nationwide protests against these bills, Mr. Modi said hollow slogans were given in favour of farmers and workers for many decades since Independence and governments at the Centre and states were formed in their name.All that farmers and labourers got was a jumbled web of promises and laws, he said.Mr. Modi said those who always lied to farmers are now “shooting from their shoulders” and misleading them.“They are spreading rumours. Saving farmers from such rumours and explaining the importance of the agriculture reforms is the responsibility and duty of all BJP workers because we have to make the future of farmers bright,” Mr. Modi said.The three bills passed by Parliament are the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020. The Congress along with many other opposition parties has claimed that the bills will harm the interest of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government. The Centre has asserted the proposed laws will be beneficial for farmers and increase their income. The prime minister also lauded the new labour laws passed by Parliament in the Monsoon session, asserting that they will ensure timely salary for over 50 crore organised and unorganised workers.Will the farm bills give farmers a choice? | The Hindu Parley In his address, Mr. Modi also said his government has been very clear that it should not excessively interfere in the lives of those who do not need the government. “The government must use its resources more on the deprived and the marginalised,” he said.“This birth anniversary of Pandit Deendayal ji is even more relevant as the reformist decisions taken by the government in recent times had the imprint of the vision shown by him,” he said.“Every BJP government, Central or State, is trying to ensure that every individual feels included in the growth of the nation and doesn’t feel ignored,” he said, adding that, “this is our motivation moving ahead”.It is fitting that faceless assessment of tax filings, one of the biggest reforms in our tax system, comes into effect from today on Deendayal Upadhyay’s birth anniversary, he noted “Our mantra and karma is Nation first,” he asserted.

History narrator Jayashree Hatangadi has been living in Visakhapatnam for several decades. An avid traveller, there are barely any areas in and around the city that she hasn’t visited. However, recently, when Wilded a city-based adventure tourism group announced a day-long trip to the unexplored areas of Paderu, she was one of the first ones to jump on the bandwagon.“Every trip to Paderu or Araku is like a new experience because I keep discovering so many things. During my first trek after the pandemic with Wilded, I learnt more about the local butterfly varieties and the types of plants that grow in the agency areas. With proper precautions like wearing masks, sanitising hands and keeping proper distance, these trips seem safe as they are away from the crowded tourist places,” she says. Experimenting with the new normal, adventure tourism groups in the city are getting back in action after the government allowed tourism activities across the State. The groups that are a huge hit among the Nature lovers in the city were not functioning due to the pandemic since February. But now with a focus on less-touristy destinations, wide-open spaces and outings in small groups , these travel groups are taking people to away from the city’s hustle to quaint tribal hamlets in Araku and Paderu. Upcoming treksHerptile Walk at Simhachalam by Wilded on Septermber 27Trek to Nelapalem Waterfalls by Treksome on October 2Wilded, which works in collaboration with Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society, was one of the first groups in the city to announce a single day trip to Madugula and Paderu after tourist spots were reopened. The trip was structured to sensitise people about snakes and introduce them to local floura and fauna. They also took people to a tribal settlement were the participants were served native food made of bamboo shoots and pumpkin leaves.“Earlier we would take groups with 25 to 30 people in one go, but keeping in mind the current need for social distancing we have reduced the group size to 12 per outing. We are also asking the participants to come in their own cars to reduce the interactions. While enrolling people for the treks we enquire about their health conditions and do not allow children and elderly people,” says Vimal Raj from Wilded.

City-based Treksome run by Samved Negi and Vivek Ravi Kiran are all set to host their first outing since February this year. “The peak time for these treks starts from July when the summer resides. We have already lost two months this year. However, our priority now has changed from giving a novel experience to arranging for a safer one. For this we have formulated a questionnaire for people willing to join us. We will check their medical history and the areas they are coming from to ensure minimum risk. We also ask if someone is undergoing a quarantine period. During the treks our volunteers will be watching out for social distancing during the treks,” says Samved, co-founder of the group.In the upcoming days the group is planning for treks in Madhavadhara, Bhimakonda and certain parts of Anantagiri forests.(You can reach Wilded at 9640856967 and Treksome at 7272067067)

 The government on Friday said it has sanctioned 670 electric buses for Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat and Chandigarh and 241 charging stations in Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat and Port Blair under Phase-II of the FAME India Scheme.Also read: How is India driving to electric mobility? Union Heavy Industries Minister Prakash Javadekar said the decision reflects the Centre’s commitment to reduce dependence on fossil fuel and address the issues of vehicular emissions, and is in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision for eco-friendly public transportation.“This is a good start, these e-buses, e-rickshaws and e-scooties as well as e-cars for city use are the best way forward for environment friendly transport,” Mr. Javadekar said. In a series of tweets, the Minister informed that 25 charging stations have been sanctioned in Kollam, 27 in Thiruvananthapuram and 28 in Malappuram (all in Kerala). Besides, 10 charging stations have been sanctioned in Port Blair and 25 in Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu.Mr. Javadekar said the setting up of charging stations is a key infrastructure necessity to promote Electric Vehicles.“Already 450 buses are plying in various cities. Now 670 e-buses are sanctioned. Maharashtra has got 240, Gujarat has got 250, Goa has got 100 and Chandigarh has got 80. Kerala and other states have also got e-charging stations because all those corporations who are completing the formalities, we are sanctioning e-buses for them,” said the minister.The Department of Heavy Industries under the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, is administering the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme since April, 2015 to promote adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles (xEVs) in India. At present, Phase-II of FAME India Scheme is being implemented for a period of 3 years with effect from April 1, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs 10,000 crore.

As the real estate sector picks up steam, courtesy new policies and low interest rates, there’s a particular consumer segment showing a renewed interest in investing: NRIs. Primary investments have come in from those settled in the UAE, Singapore, the UK and US, for properties across segments: residential, commercial and even warehousing.While NRIs have always invested in real estate back home, what has led them to continue the practice given that the past few months have been bridled with uncertainty? The current pandemic has made home-buying a lucrative option for NRIs, says Saurabh Garg, co-Founder, NoBroker, adding that a weaker rupee and lower interest rates for housing loans are additional factors. The realty search portal has seen a massive 254% increase in enquiries, a majority for ready homes, from the NRI community since March this year. “A number of policies have triggered this. Now, there is no restriction on the number of permitted immovable properties that both NRIs and OCIs may hold and rental income (for NRIs) can be repatriated freely from India without taking any specific permission. No income tax implications at the time of acquisition is another favourable policy,” he explains.Increased transparency and eased investment norms have made the market further attractive for UHNIs and NRIs, adds Anshuman Magazine, Chairman and CEO, CBRE India. With developers offering customised solutions in the form of ‘smart’ homes, he says such individuals could prefer to make an investment in the housing segment.Residential vs. commercialAffordable home prices, stricter regulatory measures along with increased transparency and greater consolidation in the sector have together created a profitable avenue for NRIs to invest in the Indian market, says Jaxay Shah, Chairman, CREDAI National. The community at large is eager to invest in residential and commercial properties in the country, with a major chunk eyeing the luxury segment for the purpose of settling down there or even renting it out. “Units with well-rounded infrastructure, penthouses, villas and bungalows in gated communities, besides branded residences and golf townships are popular,” he says.Garg says their platform has seen a good amount of interaction for both residential and commercial properties. “Residential properties account for about 76% of the enquiries. Managing such a property is much simpler when compared to handling a commercial asset. Prices have gone down and home loan interest rates have gone below 2008-09 levels which also adds up to making the residential investment first at this point in time,” he says, adding that interactions for the commercial sector are up by 120% and since the rental yields are higher, he expects better traction.NRIs can add the commercial segment to their portfolio, recommends Rajesh Gurumurthy, Senior Director and Head of Strategic Consulting at Jones Lang LaSalle. The availability of strata space in major metro cities provides flexibility for NRI investment and the rise in office space investments combined with limited vacancy (specifically for Grade A spaces) has resulted in appreciation of capital values. “There is an increasing demand for other real estate asset classes such as mall spaces in the retail segment, co-working in the commercial sector, co-living and senior living in residential, and even warehousing,” he says. At the CII Realty and Infrastructure Conclave 2020, concluded earlier this month, experts further highlighted how the demand for warehousing is now increasing due to an increase in e-commerce activities and investment from NRIs.Top factorsIf we are to look at the main parameters NRIs look at before inking a deal, those are tax benefits, ready homes, and the developer’s track record. Other factors include the foreign investment regulations of the country, mode of payment, and type of property (NRIs/OCIs cannot acquire agricultural land, plantation property, or a farmhouse). “One of the most important factors considered by NRIs is if they can invest either as a direct purchase or as a gift from a person resident in India or from an NRI/ OCI relative,” points out CREDAI’s Shah. The investor group comprises two age groups: 35 to 45 years, looking to invest in homes for their parents, and 55 to 70 years, looking at their own retirement years.Eyes on the SouthMumbai, Kochi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai and Gurgaon have received a major chunk of overseas investments this year, with a majority of funds coming into the southern states. Job opportunities in the IT/IteS sector, coupled with the rise of healthcare and manufacturing hubs, have been the chief draw. “South India has always been an attractive market for NRIs due to the availability of land at reasonable price, higher rental yields, and timely completion of projects along with good track record of developers,” says Garg, explaining that a favourable investment situation and a well-developed corporate ecosystem has boosted investments further. Other factors working in the favour of cities down south include the fact that most cities have newer and fresh markets due to the on-going infrastructure development and availability of quality social infrastructure (healthcare, education, etc.).

Popular films and literature deal with a false dichotomy between ‘mass’ themes and ‘female’ themes, with the latter often locked into overtly feminist or rom-com boxes expected to attract only female interest. Given these rigid compartments, new Hindi cinema’s light-hearted and entirely ‘mass’ focus on middle-class women and their desires, both sexual and material, is a breath of fresh air. Netflix release Dolly Kitty Aur Woh Chamakte Sitare from writer-director Alankrita Srivastava (of Lipstick Under My Burkha fame) is the latest in a series that memorably includes Suresh Triveni’s Tumhari Sulu. Dolly Kitty… builds upon a theme used in the 2019 film Dream Girl, which too was centred on a cell centre catering to lonely men. Only there, it was the male protagonist who landed the job because of his ability to speak in a falsetto, which meant not only that the focus stayed firmly on the hero but also that the real women in these centres continued to be outside the pale of storytelling interest.This film has no such qualms. When Kajal becomes Kitty for the call centre, her first sexy-romantic chat makes her nauseous but she soon embraces her task with aplomb. Her reasons for liking her new job are equally interesting — she quits a leather factory because the supervisor treats her as less than human, whereas here, in a seedier job, her personal worth is appreciated, a nuancing that’s rare in pop culture. Kajal has refused marriage, left her small town in Bihar, and come to Greater Noida on Delhi’s outskirts to earn a living. Her delight when she throws herself on ‘her’ bed (in a shared room in a ladies’ hostel) is the sheer joy of personal space, the Woolfian ‘room of one’s own’.The joy is sweeter because it also means she doesn’t have to face her brother-in-law’s pawing. Later too, when Kajal realises she has unknowingly accompanied her colleague for a paid sex gig, she runs away. Yet, this is the same Kajal-Kitty who has to sweet-talk male callers into sexual gratification, a job that gets these women called randi or prostitutes. Not only is the film saying that sex callers needn’t be sex workers, it’s also saying that all women, regardless of their profession, are entitled to choose who they sleep with. Thus, Kajal’s cousin Dolly is frigid with her husband but when she chooses her lover, she is fine.Srivastava’s systematic dismantling of middle-class morality is a bold move under a political dispensation that unhealthily obsesses over supposed sanskari values, represented in the movie by the now inevitable and ominous moral-policing, saffron-waving gang, but the film’s greater significance is possibly its accurate identification of the enormous sexual frustration and loneliness that plagues Indian society, a frustration that clearly begets the recent rise in gratuitous violence, the hankering for older patriarchal hierarchies, and the extreme fixation with religion.Equally, the film traces the financial frustration unleashed by a relentless neoliberalism. Dolly pawns jewellery and even dips into her office’s petty cash box to buy clothes, baubles, an air-conditioner. The glitzy mall, Dolly’s crowded, kitschy flat, the fancier phone for which Shazia will change lovers — it’s a world forever beckoning with its bigger-better-more mantra; a siren call that women can succumb to as unapologetically as men and for which they needn’t be judged. The film conveys this constant middle-class anxiety to reach the next richer, posher rung and yet, interestingly, it’s not money that buys Dolly and Kitty freedom but their decision to shrug off bourgeois value systems, in effect suggesting that women are imprisoned more by the patriarchy than by the economy.Dolly Kitty… doesn’t pull off this storyline with great cinematic finesse, given its structural flaws and lazy scripting. Greater Noida is hardly a village for everyone to turn up at the same event in a final scene of Hardyesque coincidence. Everything is crammed in — sexual dysfunction, Muslim lover, gender-confused child, dishonest builder — until it finally culminates with a giant, all-too-obvious artwork.Yet, showcasing that artwork and this theme is to take a stand today. Plotting the sexual and financial liberation of its protagonists from their claustrophobic middle-class mores while still locating them within that milieu is no small triumph. And, as cheesy as it is, one really must celebrate a mass movie that ends with a call centre established for lonely women! Where the writer tries to make sense of society with seven hundred words and a bit of snark.

Packed with nutrition, microgreens are fast gaining popularity. And a growing tribe of health conscious individuals are trying their hand at growing these superfoods in kitchen gardens during the pandemic. While being a plant parent can be challenging, microgreens need little space to grow. They are small plants in the next stage of sprouting, when the first leaves develop from the seed. “If you have a windowsill or balcony that gets a few hours of sunshine every day, you are good to go,” says Visakhapatnam-based S Ravi Kanth Reddy, founder of the NGO Mother Earth Environmental Consciousness Society (MEECONS), and who is an advocate of sustainable living.

Recently, Ravi Kanth and his wife Naga Vijaya, released a video on Vijaya’s Healthy Home on YouTube. The video showed how to grow microgreens through hydroponics, showing the time-lapse of the growth of such greens. “These superfoods contain abundant Vitamin C, E and anti-oxidants, and are far more nutritious than the adult leafy versions. These are ideal to throw onto a salad or sandwich. You can also garnish a dish with a dash of microgreens,” says Ravi Kanth. What to keep in mindWhen using cocopeat and soil, microgreens should be grown in flat surfaces, like a tray or cardboard box with drainage holes, that can hold up to two inches of soil.Spray water daily to keep it moist especially during the first two-three days of the germination stage.Microgreens taste best when fresh but can be refrigerated for a couple of days.The tender greens can be used as a nutritious side dish, added to smoothies or as colourful topping to salads.Use seeds that are untreated with any chemical.Good quality soil and cocopeat, which are chemical free, ensure that microgreens grow well.Be careful not to overwater them.Besides being healthy, they are also simple to grow. “They don’t need a lot of light and can be grown in four to six days. So, there is no fretting about fertilising, repoting, or pruning,” he explains. And more importantly, these greens are completely organic as you would be growing them without pesticides or fertilisers. “Seeds like those of fenugreek, wheat, green gram and mustard take just two to three days to germinate. Preparing the seed is the first step in growing microgreens. For the initial 24 hours, the seeds need to be placed in a darker place before shifting them to a bright spot,” says Ravi Kanth.Process of choiceHe used the hydroponic method which he says can be an alternative to cocopeat and soil, as these may not be easily accessible everywhere during the pandemic. “I used a stainless steel sieve, which is usually available at every household, to grow microgreens hydroponically. Wash the seeds well; spread them on the sieve and place it above a container with water; spray water twice a day and cover with a lid. Follow the process for two to three days till you see tiny leaves coming out,” he says, adding, “After this, shift the sieve along with container to a brighter spot. But do not cover it. In six days’ time, you are good to go and harvest it.”

 Communist Party of India (CPI)-Maoist on Friday appealed to people to observe bandh on Monday in Telangana State protesting against the recent ‘killingof eight of its members in Asifabad Kumarambheem and Bhadradri Kothagudem districts.Also read: Take part in guerrilla warfare, bury operation ‘Samadhan’: CPI (Maoists) appeal to cadreDescribing the exchanges of fire between police and Maoists as ‘fake encounters’, the CPI-Maoist Telangana State Committee secretary Jagan called upon people to condemn the ‘killings’ and fight against ‘TRS government’. Of late, the Maoists did not indulge in any attacks on police or TRS leaders. Still the ‘TRS government and police’ were resorting to ‘fake encounters’, he said in a statement.Rights activists and organisations should find out facts over these ‘killings’ and ensure persons responsible for the deaths secured punishment, he stated. All the slain Maoists Shankar, Srinu, Ayithu, Chukkalu, Baji Rao, Jogaiah, Raje and Lalitha belonged to Adivasi and oppressed sections.""After catching the Maoists, the government killed them instead of sending them to prisons as per the laws"", Jagan charged. TRS had misled people claiming that ‘Maoists’ agenda’ was ‘their agenda’. Soon after coming to power, TRS government began serving imperialists, capitalists and brokers at the cost of rendering justice to suppressed sections, the statement said.Rights activists and members of people’s associations raising voice against government’s actions were being branded as Maoists and lodged in prisons. Worried of people questioning the government’s actions, TRS government gave extensive powers to police officials to wipe out Maoists movement, Jagan stated.He alleged that police caught Maoist Shankar on September 3when he went to hospital due to ill health and ""eliminated"" him in Devarlagudmen. Four days later, unarmed Srinu and Ayithu were caught at Poosuguppa. They too were ""killed after being tortured"", Jagan charged in the statement.On September 19, Maoists Chukkalu and Baji Rao were picked up when they went to meet villagers in civilian clothes and later killed in Kadamba forest, he alleged. Three other Maoists were killed in near similar fashion at Chennapuram, he claimed adding that in all the incidents, stories of fake encounters were cooked up.The CPI-Maoist Telngana secretary charged that, after the killing of two Maoists in Kadamba forest, police themselves issued a statement in the name of Maoist state committee member Bhaskar alias Adellu condemning the encounter to create confusion.

The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a plea seeking to postpone the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.A three-judge bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R. Subhash Reddy and M R Shah also refused to grant liberty to the petitioner to give representation to the Election Commission in this regard. “We can’t permit everybody to go to the Election Commission. We can only permit you to withdraw the petition,” the bench said. The matter was then dismissed as withdrawn. The EC is set to announce the schedule for Bihar assembly elections on Friday.

 The legendary Sunil Gavaskar on Friday found himself in the midst of a controversy for making an unsavoury comment against Virat Kohli and his wife Anushka Sharma after the Indian captain’s forgettable outing in the IPL. After dropping two catches, Kohli, undoubtedly one of the best when it comes to chases, failed with the bat, managing just a run off five balls against Kings XI Punjab here on Thursday night. In the commentary box, Gavaskar came up with a comment involving Kohli’s actor wife Anushka. The remark was in bad taste and did not go down well with the RCB skipper’s fans, with some of them urging the BCCI to remove Gavaskar from the commentary panel. Over the years, on quite a few instances, the Bollywood actress has been blamed whenever the now 31-year-old Kohli under-performed on the cricket field. The Indian batting mainstay had a forgettable outing at the Dubai International Stadium. Kohli dropped his KXIP counterpart KL Rahul twice — once in the 17th over at deep square-leg when he was batting on 83 and then again in the 18th over when he was on 89.  The KXIP skipper then went on to shatter a few record on the way to a 69-ball 132 — the highest scored by an Indian in an IPL game.

 Agriculture Secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi said that Tamil Nadu was the first State in the country to have passed a Bill in the State Legislative Assembly over contract farming in 2019, even before the Centre passed the legislation in the Parliament.The legislation for contract farming would help farmers get a fair price for their agricultural produce through contracts with companies buying their produce. “With contracts in writing, farmers can get a price agreed upon by both parties for sure, in exchange for their agricultural produce,” he said. Replying to a query, Mr. Bedi pointed out that it was a voluntary scheme and those who were not interested could continue to sell their agricultural produce like before, and there was no compulsion for them to join.

Pakistan’s minority Hindus rallied late on Thursday in Islamabad, briefly clashing with the police, to protest the deaths of 11 members of a Hindu migrant family who died in India last month under mysterious circumstances.Also read: Rajasthan police suspect mass murder in Pakistani Hindu migrants’ caseSince then, the dead migrants’ relatives have held small rallies in Pakistan’s southern Sindh province but this was the first time they had taken their demonstration to the country’s capital, vowing to stage a sit-in near the Indian Embassy.According to Rajasthan Police, the recovery of a written note from a shack in Jodhpur district’s Lodta village, where 11 members of a family of Pakistani Hindu migrants were found dead, has suggested that one of the deceased, trained as a nurse, gave sedatives and injected everyone with poison, before taking her own life.Preliminary investigation by the police found that the injections were given in a professional manner probably by a daughter of the head of the family, who also injected the poison through a cannula later in her leg. The absence of injury marks on the victims’ bodies ruled out the possibility of mass suicide.

Earlier this year under pressure from radical Muslims, Pakistani authorities halted construction of a Hindu temple in Islamabad.Ramesh Kumar, a top leader of the Hindu community who led Thursday’s protest, met on Wednesday with Pakistan’s Foreign Minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, seeking his help in pressuring India to release results of the initial police probe into the case.Pakistan has also asked for access to a Hindu worker who was at the Jodhpur farm at the time of the deaths, according to government officials.In his meeting with Mr. Qureshi, Mr. Kumar said Shrimati Mukhi, the daughter of the head of the family that died, had levelled the poisoning accusations. She earlier this month told local media that India allegedly pressured the family to issue a statement denouncing Pakistan’s government. There was no official comment from India on the allegations.Last week, Pakistan summoned an Indian diplomat to convey concerns over the “Jodhpur incident.” A subsequent ministry statement said India had “failed to share any substantive details regarding the cause and circumstances of the deaths” of the Hindus and asked for a comprehensive investigation.

The Road Transport Authority officials in Anantapur unearthed a major scam in which a gang worked like a well-oiled machine and cheated several people, stole their cars and hoodwinked the Andhra Pradesh Transport Department to avoid paying lifetime road tax running into lakhs.Deputy Transport Commissioner N. Sivaram Prasad said they chanced upon two vehicles that were re-registered using old registration numbers that had gone out of the state, taking no-objection certificates. “They utilised a loophole in the software of the department, where if a vehicle owner obtains an NoC, the entire data related to that particular vehicle number vanishes from the active screen/database of the RTA officers,” Mr. Prasad said.Some unscrupulous persons bought cars (five Innova 2.5 G and Innova Crysta 2.8 V) on automobile finance without investing any amount and did not pay it back, telling them that the cars were stolen and lodged a police complaint too to hoodwink them. Those vehicles were brought to Tadipatri in Anantapur district and in likely connivance (yet to be established) of RTA officials, found out the numbers of vehicles that had gone out of the State taking NoCs and had only registration certificates.Three data entry provisions given as part of customer convenience on APRTA Citizens’ Portal for uploading PDF version of paper RCs, of old vehicles coming from other states, conversion of those in transport category to non-transport category and entering data for all non-migrated vehicles by the owners before validating the facts with their thumb impression, were misused.They entered scanned copies of fake RC, gave original engine and chassis numbers and since there was no physical check by the RTA officials, new vehicles got registered on old certificates and were sold to people here for a throwaway price. The vehicles, which cost about ₹25 lakh, were sold for ₹13.5 lakh and ₹15 lakh and overzealous customers lapped them up without looking at the papers or bought them, knowing fully well that they were stolen vehicles.Six such vehicles were confiscated by the DTC Anantapur and RTO Anantapur DSM Varaprasad along with their team after verifying the facts of old number retrieving data from the back-end servers. Some vehicles were still running in Telangana and Karnataka with the old number.Out of the six vehicles, one was confiscated from Kalyandurg in the district, one in Owk in Kurnool district, Four in Tadipatri bearing numbers — AP39EL5688; AP39ES6399; AP39EM1359 (Maruti Dezire); APEX1566; AP39EM8199; and AP39ET 1566 (rest of the five were Innovas).

Facebook Inc said on Thursday it has dismantled three networks of fake accounts which could be used by Russia's intelligence services to leak hacked documents as part of efforts to disrupt the upcoming U.S. election.The company said the accounts, which it suspended for using fake identities and other types of “coordinated inauthentic behaviour,” were linked to Russian intelligence and people associated with a St. Petersburg-based organisation accused by U.S. officials of working to sway the 2016 presidential vote.The Russian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment after normal working hours in Moscow. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations of election meddling and says it does not interfere in the domestic politics of other countries.Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said there was no immediate evidence that hacked documents were about to be leaked, but by suspending the accounts Facebook hoped to prevent them being used in any subsequent operation.“Our team watches for the threats and trends that we need to be ready for, and one that we are very aware of ... is a hack-and-leak operation, particularly in the next 6-8 weeks,” he told Reuters.“We want to make sure that the accounts are down to prevent their ability to pivot them to facilitate a hack-and-leak around the U.S. election.”Facebook said the networks were small with only a handful of accounts on its website and photo-sharing service Instagram, some of which posed as independent media outlets and think tanks. The accounts had a combined total of around 97,000 followers.While some of the activity did target audiences in Britain and the United States, the networks were predominantly focused on countries in the Middle East and bordering Russia, such as Syria, Turkey, Ukraine and Belarus, Facebook said.Twitter Inc said it had worked with Facebook to identify and remove 350 accounts operated by state-linked organisations in Russia.Both companies said one of the networks had been identified following a tip from the FBI, which warned on Tuesday that foreign actors and cybercriminals were likely to spread disinformation about the results of the November 3 election.The warnings follow an alert by Microsoft Corp earlier this month that hackers linked to Russia, China, and Iran are trying to spy on people tied to both U.S. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.Graham Brookie, director of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, worked with Facebook to analyse the suspended accounts. He said the activity showed Russia was continuing efforts to exacerbate political tensions in the United States and elsewhere.“That doesn't dismiss the fact that the scale and scope of domestic disinformation is far greater than what any foreign adversary could do,” he said. “But Russia's efforts remain an extremely serious national security vulnerability.”

The powerful head of the Vatican’s saint-making office, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, resigned suddenly on Thursday from the post and renounced his rights as a cardinal amid a financial scandal that has reportedly implicated him indirectly. The Vatican provided no details on why Pope Francis accepted Becciu’s resignation in a statement late on Thursday. In the one-sentence announcement, the Holy See said only that Francis had accepted Becciu’s resignation as prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints “and his rights connected to the cardinalate.” Becciu, the former No. 2 in the Vatican’s secretariat of state, has been reportedly implicated in a financial scandal involving the Vatican’s investment in a London real estate deal that has lost the Holy See millions of euros in fees paid to middlemen. The Vatican prosecutor has placed several Vatican officials under investigation, as well as the middlemen, but not Becciu. Becciu has defended the soundness of the original investment and denied any wrongdoing, and it’s not clear whether the scandal itself was behind his resignation or possibly sparked a separate line of inquiry. But the late-breaking news of his resignation, the severity of his apparent sanction, the Vatican’s tight-lipped release and the unexpected downfall of one of the most powerful Vatican officials all suggested a shocking new chapter in the scandal, which has convulsed the Vatican for the past year. Not the firstThe last time a cardinal’s rights were removed was when American Theodore McCarrick renounced his rights and privileges as a cardinal in July 2018 amid a sexual abuse investigation. He was subsequently defrocked altogether by Francis last year for sexually abusing adults as well as minors. Before him, the late Scottish Cardinal Keith O’Brien in 2015 relinquished the rights and privileges of being a cardinal after unidentified priests alleged sexual misconduct. O’Brien was, however, allowed to retain the cardinal’s title and he died a member of the College of Cardinals, the elite group of churchmen whose main job is to elect a pope. In the Vatican statement, the Holy See identified Becciu as “His Eminence Cardinal Angelo Becciu,” making clear he remained a cardinal but without any rights. At 72, Becciu would have been able to participate in a possible future conclave to elect Francis’ successor. Cardinals over age 80 can’t vote. But by renouncing his rights as a cardinal, Becciu has relinquished his rights to take part. Becciu was the “substitute,” or top deputy in the secretariat of state from 2011 to 2018, when Francis made him a cardinal and moved him into the Vatican’s saint-making office. He straddled two pontificates, having been named by Pope Benedict XVI and entrusted with essentially running the Curia, or Vatican bureaucracy, a position that gave him enormous influence and power. Financial issues The financial problems date from 2014, when the Vatican entered into a real estate venture by investing over $200 million in a fund run by an Italian businessman. The deal gave the Holy See 45% of the luxury building at 60 Sloane Ave. in London’s Chelsea neighborhood. The money came from the secretariat of state’s asset portfolio, which is funded in large part by the Peter’s Pence donations of Catholics around the world for the pope to use for charity and Vatican expenses. The Holy See decided in November 2018, after Becciu had left the secretariat of state, to exit the fund, end its relationship with the businessman and buy out the remainder of the building. It did so after Becciu’s successor determined that the mortgage was too onerous and that the businessman was losing money for the Vatican in some of the fund’s other investments. The buyout deal, however, cost the Holy See tens of millions of euros more and sparked the Vatican investigation that has so far implicated a half-dozen Vatican employees. Becciu has insisted he wasn’t in power during the 2018 buyout deal and always acted in the sole interests of the Holy See. In the Vatican prosecutor’s initial warrant, Becciu is not named, and it remains unclear if his role in managing the secretariat of state’s vast asset portfolio was connected with the resignation. Francis would meet regularly with Becciu in the Italian’s role as prefect of the saint-making office, since every month or two he would present lists of candidates for possible beatification or canonization for Francis to approve. In addition, since the beginning of his pontificate, Francis had an annual luncheon date at Becciu’s apartment along with 10 priests on the Thursday of Holy Week leading up to Easter. The Vatican always reported the get-togethers were a chance for the pope to chat informally with Becciu and priests of his diocese on the day the church celebrates the institution of the priesthood. The luncheon didn’t happen this year amid the Vatican’s coronavirus lockdown.

 Pakistan’s former prime minister and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif on Thursday barred his party members from holding any private meetings with the country’s military leadership. The move came a day after the Pakistan’s main opposition party found itself in an embarrassing position following army spokesperson Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar’s confirmation that senior PML-N leader Mohammad Zubair had held two meetings with Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to discuss the future of Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz. Interestingly, a conference of all mainstream opposition parties on Sunday had accused the military establishment of interfering in Pakistan’s politics and elections. If necessitated by national security or constitutional requirements, such meetings in the future will be approved by the party’s leadership and will be made public, Sharif wrote on his personal Twitter account.“Recent events once again prove how some meetings remain hidden behind seven veils while others are given the colour of choice through publicising them. This game should now stop...I am instructing my party that no member in private, individual or collective capacity will meet any representative of army or intelligence agencies,” he said. Addressing the Sunday’s All Party Conference via a video link from London, Sharif had lashed out at the army, saying there was a state above the state in the country . The conference’s communique also called for an end to establishment’s interference in politics and no role of armed forces and intelligence agencies in future elections.  Sharif, his daughter and party vice president Maryam and son-in-law Muhammad Safdar were convicted in the Avenfield properties case on July 6, 2018. Sharif, who was deposed in 2017, was also sentenced to seven years in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills case in December 2018. But, he was bailed out in both cases and also allowed to go to London for medical treatment. He was given eight weeks to return but failed to come back due to health complications.

 Singapore's population has shrunk for the first time since 2003 as travel curbs and job losses brought about by the coronavirus pandemic have pushed foreign workers from the global business hub.Also read: COVID-hit Mustafa Centre in Singapore to send back foreign workersThe overall population dropped by about 18,000 people, or 0.3%, to 5.69 million, according to an annual population report.A sharp drop in foreigners, down 2% to 1.64 million, as well as a marginal fall in permanent residents, outweighed a modest rise in citizens, some of whom returned from overseas as the pandemic spread globally.“These trends were largely due to COVID-19 related challenges, brought about by weak demand and travel restrictions,” the report said, citing job losses in services, a sector heavily reliant on low-paid foreign labour.As the economy faces the deepest recession in its history — an economic decline officially estimated between 5%-7% for the year — the government has been raising barriers for foreign hiring to preserve jobs for locals.But authorities in the low-tax corporate hub, home to the Asian headquarters of many multinational companies, have also warned that a populist turn could hurt business.“We must be careful not to give the wrong impression that we are now closing up and no longer welcoming foreigners,” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech earlier this month, after an election in which opposition parties criticised the government's immigration policies as too slack.Singapore's non-resident population has more than doubled over the last 20 years, powering population growth in a city-state with one of the world's lowest birth rates.This has prompted recurring concerns about competition for jobs and the strains on public infrastructure, which again came to the fore on the July 10 ballot, in which the ruling People's Action Party ceded a record number of seats to the opposition.“As activities ramp up there may be a manpower shortage again down the road,” said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank.

Throughout my life, and I’m afraid to say, even until sometime after I was introduced to nature and wildlife, I had the misconception that insects were dependent on plants for food. In 2016, I discovered the vicious Robber Fly at the Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Gurugram. With over 7,000 species described, the world of these Robber Flies, is so diverse that an entire family, Asilidae, has been created for them. They’re named for their feeding behaviour: they ‘rob’ other insects of their lives!They come in various colours but the ones found in Delhi-NCR are mostly brown and black. Although humans may only be able to see two large compound eyes on heads of Robber Flies, they do have three small simple eyes (called ocelli) wedged between those two big eyes. There’s also a bristly moustache — more than a fashion statement, this deters struggling prey from causing damage to the Robber Fly. Their agile flight, impeccable eyesight, quick reflexes, and strong spiny legs help them catch insects in flight: other flies, beetles, grasshoppers, butterflies, moths, carnivorous dragonflies. They even feast on spiders sometimes. They pierce their strong dagger-like proboscis (tubular straw-like organ to take in food) into their prey, usually between the head and thorax, to subdue them. They inject victims with their saliva containing neurotoxic enzymes to paralyze, and proteolytic enzymes to liquify the innards of their prey. They then fly off with the prey between their legs to an undisturbed branch, where they suck the innards through the proboscis.They patiently stalk other insects from vantage points and make a swift yet graceful, silent flight on the first opening they see It took me almost two years to actually see this opportunistic assassin hunt another black fly in air. This behaviour has also brought them their other name: Assassin Flies. Like all insects, they too have a three-segmented body: head, thorax, and abdomen. The females lay eggs using an ovipositor attached to the abdomen, a tubular organ that helps them store and lay eggs. The eggs are laid in plants close to the ground or in nooks and crannies of soil or wooden barks. When the eggs hatch, the larvae generally lives in soil or in wood and is predatory in nature, feeding on eggs and larvae of other insects. In short, the species in both larvae as well as the adult stage is a bane for other beings. In order to withstand the extreme winter, Robber Flies often overwinter in the soil as larvae or as pupa before emerging when they feel that the climatic conditions are favourable. I always thought I’d have to be in the wilder areas of the city to see this magnificent creature but I recently saw it in an urban park in front of my house.These predators maintain a delicate balance in the food chain and also help rid your backyard of pests. Participants on our nature trails have also witnessed Robber Flies being hunted by bigger dragonflies in the vicinity, but these instances are rare.

He promised a $25,000 Tesla electric car that would be available in about three years.If successful, it would be much cheaper than any other Tesla car. Currently, Tesla’s cheapest model is Tesla 3 which was priced at $35,000 during its release in February 2019.Musk said the cheaper version of the car would be capable of driving fully autonomously. However, the task might not be an easy one for Tesla since the sensors required for even partly autonomous vehicles are expensive.

Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli has been fined ₹12 lakh after his team maintained a slow over-rate during their Indian Premier League match against Kings XI Punjab here.RCB were thrashed by 97 runs in the match on Thursday night.“As it was his team’s first offence of the season under the IPL’s Code of Conduct relating to minimum over-rate offences, Mr. Kohli was fined ₹12 lakh,” the IPL said in a release.The Indian batting mainstay had a forgettable outing at the Dubai International Stadium.While he dropped two catches of centurion KL Rahul, which proved to be costly, Kohli also could not contribute anything substantial with the willow.On the other hand, his KXIP counterpart Rahul shattered a few record on the way to a 69-ball 132 — the highest scored by an Indian in an IPL game.Takes blame for dropping Rahul twiceKohli dropped Rahul twice — once in the 17th over at deep square-leg when he was batting on 83 and then again in the 18th over when he was on 89.Kohli took the blame for dropping Kings XI Punjab skipper KL Rahul twice, which contributed significantly to their defeat on Thursday.Kohli felt had he not dropped two catches off the blade of Rahul, who remained unbeaten on 132, KXIP would not have been able to go past the 200-run mark.“I have to stand in front and take the brunt of it, not the best day in the office, couple of important chances of KL when he was set and that cost us 35-40 runs at a later stage.“Maybe if we restricted them to 180 we wouldn’t have been under pressure from ball one of the chase,” said Kohli at the post-match presentationThe lapses helped KXIP score an imposing 206 for 3, with Rahul doing the bulk of scoring.

Half-a-dozen Haryana districts sharing border with Punjab are expected to hit the most by the call for nationwide bandh on Fr​iday by a wide coalition of farmers' unions in protest against the newly-passed agriculture bills.The farmers, along with the arthiyas (commission agents), are expected to join hands to shut the food-grains markets in these districts and hold demonstrations to express their anger against the bills. The districts expected to be impacted the most in Haryana include Kurukshetra, Ambala, Yamuna Nagar, Panchkula, Jind and Kaithal.In addition to sharing a border with Punjab, which has witnessed the strongest opposition to the bills, these districts have a strong Bharatiya Kisan Union presence. The union is spearheading the bharat bandh.BKU Harayana chief Gurnam Singh Charuni told The Hindu that several traders associations and commission agents have pledged support to the protest. “We expect the markets and food-grains markets to remain shut. Our workers would also attempt roadblocks where we have strong presence. But the protests will be all peaceful,” he said.Mr. Charuni himself will be part of protests at several points in Kurukshetra, Yamuna Nagar and Ambala starting from Pinjore in Panchkula.

Thailand’s government lodged complaints with police on Thursday against Facebook and Twitter, alleging they failed to comply with court orders to block content judged illegal under Thai law. Minister of Digital Economy and Society Buddhipongse Punnakanta said at a news conference that it was the first time his ministry has taken such action against the social media companies under Thailand’s Computer Crime Act. It has prosecuted website and account owners and users in the past. The Ministry filed the complaints at the police Technology Crime Suppression Division, where Mr. Buddhipongse said the companies had failed to meet 15-day deadlines issued by the courts to block hundreds of accounts. He said the targeted sites were banned because they contained illegal content related to online gambling, pornography, drugs or the monarchy, a highly sensitive subject. The ministry also filed complaints against parties using five accounts to disseminate material considered offensive during a large anti-government rally this past weekend. Buddhipongse said Facebook had blocked access in Thailand to 215 of the 661 accounts his ministry had requested. Twitter had blocked four of 69 accounts, he said. Police Col. Siriwat Deepor, deputy chief of the Technology Crime Suppression Division, said the two companies could face fines of not more than 200,000 baht (USD 6,325) and an additional daily fine of 5,000 baht (USD 158) for each day the accounts remain unblocked. Kate Hayes, a spokeswoman for Facebook’s Asia-Pacific operations, said the company did not have any comment for now on the Thai action. A spokesman for Twitter could not be reached. In August, the Ministry of of Digital Economy and Society successfully pressured Facebook to block a popular page about the monarchy. We are protecting our sovereignty, which may not mean protecting physical borders in the traditional sense but rather ... protecting our cyber sovereignty, Buddhipongse said at the time. He declared that such attacks happen fast and are constantly damaging Thais.

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for an “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India) is an important initiative, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday.“The economic package under this self-reliant India initiative, which was announced in the aftermath of the coronavirus shock, has supported the Indian economy and mitigated significant downside risks, so we do see that initiative as having been important,” Gerry Rice, Director, Communications Department, IMF, told reporters at his fortnightly news conference here. Looking ahead, as the Prime Minister has said, for India to play a more important part in the global economy, pursuing policies that stimulate by improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy is critical, he said, responding to a question on Mr. Modi’s call for an “Aatmanirbhar Bharat.”“To achieve the stated ‘Make For The World’ goal in India, the priority is to remain focussed on policies that can help further integrate India in the global value chain, including through trade, investment and technology,” Mr. Rice said. Responding to another question, he said the IMF’s joint study with the NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Finance shows that to achieve a high performance in health-related sustainable development goals, India would need to gradually increase its total spending in the healthcare sector from the current 3.7% of the GDP.“More generally, beyond the health sector, comprehensive structural reforms are needed to achieve more inclusive and sustainable medium-term growth,” he said.“We have talked about those reforms before — infrastructure, land reforms, product market and labour market reforms, increasing female labour force participation, access to finance and better jobs,” Mr. Rice said.

Farmers in Telangana are unlikely to join the nationwide strike called by All India Coordination Committee of Farmers Movements on September 25. Farmers across the country are protesting the passage of three bills in Parliament that seek to reorganise marketing of farm produce. However, All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee is planning to stage a protest near Aayakar Bhavan in Basheerbagh area at 11.30 a.m. on Friday.“I sell my sona masoori rice directly to customers. When I grow marigold flowers in winter, I sell them at the Gudimalkapur market where I have to pay 10% margin to the seth (trader),” says Srinivas Reddy, a farmer. “The market yard has a very limited use to us. Only farmers who borrow from traders and sell the produce through them will be affected,” says Mr. Reddy. While the commission to be paid at the market is fixed at 4%, multiple farmers said they had to pay 10% commission in addition to transporting the produce and scouting for buyers. The nearest market yards from Pudur are Vikarabad and Chevella. Food Corporation of India procurement and production data over the past five years (2015-2020) shows that nearly a quarter of farmers in Telangana did not access the marketplace for the MSP fixed by the central government. While rice procurement by FCI averaged between 95% to 79% in Punjab, it averaged between 77% and 51.8% in Telangana. Nationally, FCI procured between 37.5% and 32.7% of the rice produced in five years. “We prefer to sell it directly to retailers. Rice mills procure from farmers and give an incentive per vehicle,” says Kadavati Ramcharan who takes land on cowl (lease) and cultivates rice, vegetables and flowers in Pudur. While protests broke out in many parts of the country after the passage of the three bills, it has hardly caused a ripple among the farmer community in Telangana. Farmers who produce fruits and other perishables are however worried how the changes in the marketplace will impact them. “No business is possible without dalals (middlemen). Some farmers have contracts with corporates but they buy only the A-Grade produce. What about the rest? How do we sell that?” asks Prabhakar Reddy who cultivates carrots, tomatoes and other vegetables on three-acres.Among the new players in the market is an agri-tech startup which says is ‘revolutionising fresh produce supply chain’. It has a procurement centre near Ibrahimpalle on Chevella-Vikarabad Rd. “A day before the procurement our field officer visits the farm and informs the farmer about the quantity we need. We check quality while procuring and send the produce to our Kompally warehouse,” says Raju who manages the centre. The market yards are controlled by ruling party leaders. The first change in state government inevitably leads to change in the power structure of the market committee. “The ruling party nominates the chairperson who ensures fair trade,” says Madhav Reddy who works at the Chevella market yard.

The number of novel coronavirus cases in the United States topped 7 million on Thursday — more than 20% of the world's total — as Midwest states reported spikes in COVID-19 infections in September, according to a Reuters tally.The latest milestone comes just days after the nation surpassed over 200,000 COVID-19 deaths, the world's highest death toll from the virus. Each day, over 700 people die in the United States from COVID-19.California leads the country with over 800,000 total cases, followed by Texas, Florida and New York. All Midwest states except Ohio reported more cases in the past four weeks as compared with the prior four weeks, led by South Dakota and North Dakota. South Dakota had the biggest percentage increase at 166% with 8,129 new cases, while North Dakotas new cases doubled to 8,752 as compared to 4,243 during the same time in August.Many cases in those two states have been linked to the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, that annually attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors.According to a Reuters analysis, positive cases rose in half of the 50 U.S. states this month. Ten states have reported a record one-day increase in COVID-19 cases in September.New cases rose last week after falling for eight consecutive weeks. Health experts believe this spike was due to reopening schools and universities as well as parties over the recent Labour Day holiday.A study by researchers from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Indiana University, the University of Washington and Davidson College said recent reopening of college and university campuses for in-person instruction during late summer this year could be associated with more than 3,000 additional cases of COVID-19 per day in the United States in recent weeks.U.S. confirmed cases are the highest in the world followed by India with 5.7 million cases and Brazil with 4.6 million.The United States is currently averaging 40,000 new infections per day. Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci has said he would like to see the number to fall below 10,000 per day before flu season starts in October.Health officials and President Donald Trump have presented different views about the nation's health crisis. Mr. Trump, who is seeking re-election to a second term on November 3, early this month had claimed that the United States was rounding the corner on the crisis. Dr. Fauci contradicted the claim the next day, saying the statistics were disturbing.

State president of the BJP Nalin Kumar Kateel said here on Thursday that Minister of State for Railways Suresh Channabasappa Angadi who passed away in Delhi on Wednesday was a simple man with the heart of a child. Speaking at a condolence meeting in the party’s district office here, Mr. Kateel, also a Member of Parliament from Dakshina Kannada, said that Mr. Angadi had built educational institutions in North Karnataka. He did not compromise with the principles and discipline of the BJP and worked in a Lok Sabha constituency which posed many a challenge. He took both Marathi and Kannada-speaking people into confidence and had convinced both the groups of the need for peace whenever there was trouble over language and other such issues. Hence, he could win from Belagavi constituency four times. As a Minister of State for Railways he made significant contribution to the State by sanctioning various trains and projects. He used to work hard and was instrumental in building the BJP in North Karnataka. The late Minister never lost his temper in any situation and was a kind-hearted man. His death was a great loss to the BJP and the country, particularly the State, Mr. Kateel said.

Rio de Janeiro delayed its annual Carnival parade, saying Thursday night that the global spectacle cannot go ahead in February because of Brazil’s continued vulnerability to the pandemic. Rio’s League of Samba Schools, LIESA, announced that the spread of the coronavirus has made it impossible to safely hold the traditional parades that are a cultural mainstay and, for many, a source of livelihood. “Carnival is a party upon which many humble workers depend. The samba schools are community institutions, and the parades are just one detail of all that,” said Luiz Antonio Simas, a historian who specialises in Rio’s Carnival. “An entire cultural and productive chain was disrupted by COVID.” Rio’s City Hall has yet to announce a decision about the Carnival street parties that also take place across the city. But its tourism promotion agency said in a statement on September 17 that without a coronavirus vaccine, it is uncertain when large public events can resume. A full yearBrazil’s first confirmed coronavirus case was February 26, one day after this year’s Carnival ended. As the number of infections grew, the samba schools that participate in the glitzy annual parade halted preparations for the 2021 event. Thursday’s announcement removed the cloud of uncertainty that has hung over the city — one of worst hit by the pandemic in Brazil. Nearly all of Rio’s samba schools are closely linked to working class communities. Their processions include elaborate floats accompanied by tireless drummers and costumed dancers who sing at the top of their lungs to impress a panel of judges. Tens of thousands of spectators pack the bleachers of the arena, known as the Sambadrome, while tens of millions watch on television. Before the schools began competing in the 1930s, Carnival was celebrated in dance halls and haphazardly on the streets, Mr. Simas said. The parades entered the Sambadrome in the 1980s, and have become Rio’s quintessential Carnival display. The immense labour required for each show was already stymied by restrictions on gatherings that Rio’s governor imposed in March. Even with those measures, Rio’s metropolitan region, home to 13 million people, so far has recorded more than 15,000 deaths from COVID-19. Beneath the Sambadrome’s bleachers, the city created a homeless shelter for the vulnerable population during the pandemic. Samba schools suspended float construction, costume sewing, dance rehearsals, and also social projects. The Mangueira school’s program in the favela near downtown Rio that teaches music to children — keeping them away from crime, and cultivating the school’s future drummers — hasn’t held classes since March. The pulse of entire suburban Rio cities like Nilopolis, whose population of 1,60,000 cheers the Beija-Flor samba school, has faded, Mr. Simas said. Some performers resorted to odd jobs and gigs. Diogo Jesus, the lead dancer referred to as “master of ceremonies” in the Mocidade school, couldn’t make rent without his income from private events. He started driving for Uber and sewing facemasks to sell at a fair. “It was a blow. We live Carnival all year round, and many people when they realized everything would stop wound up getting sick or depressed,” Mr. Jesus said in an interview inside his house in Madureira, a neighborhood in northern Rio. “Carnival is our life.” “We must await the coming months for definition about if there will be a vaccine or not, and when there will be immunisation,” LIESA’s Castanheira told reporters in Rio on Thursday. “We don’t have the safety conditions to set a date.” Only precedentThe last year Rio’s Carnival was suspended was 1912, following the death of the foreign relations minister. The mayor of Rio, at the time Brazil’s capital, postponed by two months all licenses for the popular dance associations’ Carnival parties, according to Luís Cláudio Villafañe, a diplomat and author of the book The Day They Delayed Carnival. The mayor also voiced opposition to unregulated celebrations, but many Rio residents partied in the streets anyway. Revellers were undeterred during World War II. And they poured into the street every year during more than two decades of military dictatorship, until 1985, with government censors reviewing costumes, floats and song lyrics. The 2020 coronavirus already forced Rio’s City Hall to scrap traditional plans for its second-biggest party, New Year’s Eve, which draws millions of people to Copacabana beach for dazzling fireworks. Earlier this month, the city’s tourism promotion agency Riotur announced that main tourist spots will instead display light and music shows to be broadcast over the internet. Delay of the Carnival parade will deprive Rio state of much needed tourism revenue. In 2020, Carnival drew 2.1 million visitors and generated 4 billion reais ($725 million) in economic activity, according to Riotur. A statement from the agency Thursday provided no further clarity on the fate of the Carnival street parties. Some parties are small — for example one including a few dozen dog owners exhibiting their pets wearing wigs or funny hats. But most feature amps blasting music to throngs of thousands who dance, kiss and swill booze in a crush of celebration. The biggest one boasts more than two million party-goers. Rita Fernandes, president of Os Blocos da Sebastiana, said her association already cancelled its 11 street parties that together draw 1.5 million revelers. Most others groups will follow, she said. “We cannot be irresponsible and bring the multitudes to the street,” she said, pointing to Europe’s second wave of contagion. After several weeks of declining daily infections, Rio authorities have begun expressing concern about an uptick. Public spaces such as beaches have been crowded in violation of pandemic restrictions. A drummer in Mangueira’s samba school, Laudo Braz Neto, said the children he instructed before the pandemic are listless, and he knows there is no way to put on Carnival without being able to safely gather. “Carnival will only really happen when the whole world can travel. It’s a spectacle the world watches, brings income and movement here,” he said. “I have no hope for 2021.”

 A Chinese pharmaceutical company said on Thursday the coronavirus vaccine it is developing should be ready by early 2021 for distribution worldwide, including the United States. Yin Weidong, the CEO of SinoVac, vowed to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell CoronaVac in the United States if it passes its third and final round of testing in humans. Mr. Yin said he personally has been given the experimental vaccine. “At the very beginning, our strategy was designed for China and for Wuhan. Soon after that in June and July we adjusted our strategy, that is to face the world,” Mr. Yin said, referring to the Chinese city were the virus first emerged. “Our goal is to provide the vaccine to the world including the U.S., EU and others,” Mr. Yin said. Stringent regulations in the U.S., European Union, Japan and Australia have historically blocked the sale of Chinese vaccines. But Mr. Yin said that could change. SinoVac is developing one of China’s top four vaccine candidates along with state-owned SinoPharm, which has two in development, and military-affiliated private firm CanSino. More than 24,000 people are participating in clinical trials of CoronaVac in Brazil, Turkey, and Indonesia, with additional trials scheduled for Bangladesh and possibly Chile, Mr. Yin said. SinoVac chose those countries because they all had serious outbreaks, large populations and limited research and development capacity, he said. SinoVac is also starting to test small doses of CoronaVac on children and the elderly in China after noticing rising numbers of cases globally among those two groups. Mr. Yin said the company would prioritise distribution of the vaccine to countries hosting human trials of CoronaVac. While the vaccine has not yet passed the phase 3 clinical trials, a globally accepted standard, SinoVac has already injected thousands of people in China under an emergency use provision. Mr. Yin said he was one of the first to receive the experimental vaccine months ago along with researchers after phase one and two of human trials showed no serious adverse effects. He said that self-injecting showed his support for CoronaVac. “This is kind of a tradition of our company,” Mr. Yin said, adding that he had done the same with a hepatitis vaccine under development. Earlier this year, China permitted “emergency use” of vaccine candidates for at-risk populations like border personnel and medical workers if companies could show “good safety and good antibodies” from tests of about 1,000 people, Mr. Yin said. SinoVac received that approval in June along with SinoPharm and CanSino, and was able to provide tens of thousands of doses of CoronaVac to Beijing’s municipal government, Mr. Yin said. SinoVac employees qualified for emergency use of the vaccine because an outbreak inside the company would cripple its ability to develop a vaccine, he said. About 90% of the company’s staff have received it. “We are confident that our research of the COVI-19 vaccines can meet the standards of the U.S. and EU countries,” Mr. Yin said.

 The rural upstate New York hamlet of Swastika is keeping its name, despite a complaint that it symbolises the hate and intolerance of the Nazi regime. The unincorporated crossroads in the Adirondack Mountain town of Black Brook, about 56 kilometres south of the U.S.-Canada border, has been known as Swastika for more than a century. But town council members considered a name change after a visitor from New York City said it was offensive and disrespectful to the memory of the World War II veterans buried in graves in the nearby countryside. Michael Alcamo said he was bicycling through the area this summer when he came upon Swastika.“I was stunned that the people who live there would not have a meeting and pick a different name sometime after 1945, if not prior,” Mr. Alcamo said on Thursday. The council members met on September 14 and unanimously nixed a name change.“We regret that individuals, from out of the area, that lack the knowledge of the history of our community become offended when they see the name,” Black Brook supervisor Jon Douglass wrote in an email on Thursday. “To the members of our community, that the board represents, it is the name that their ancestors chose.” The symbol has been indelibly linked to Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party since the 1930s, though crosses with arms bent at 90-degree angles have adorned art for thousands of years before the Holocaust in which six million Jews were killed. The town’s name comes from the Sanskrit word meaning well-being. State Senator James Skoufis questioned in a tweet on Thursday whether the debate would have looked different if one of the council members was Jewish. He also called for legislation.“Since the town board will not do the right thing, I will be introducing legislation, prohibiting the use of the name,” Mr. Skoufis said. One of the four council members who voted to keep the name, Howard Aubin, told the Adirondack Daily Enterprise that “only an intolerant person” would assume that the name is connected to Nazis.Mr. Douglass said the name came from settlers in the 1800s. The Press-Republican of Plattsburgh related a different story in a 1977 article that quoted a former postmaster as saying the rural community was once known as Goodrich Mills, but became known as Swastika in 1913 after that name appeared on the local post office.Mr. Douglass, who did not take part in the vote, told NPR people have requested the name be changed several times before, including after World War II.“And some of the residents that were from that area actually fought in World War II and refused to change the name just because Hitler tried to tarnish the meaning of swastika,” he said.Mr. Alcamo said he was disappointed but hopes the town will reconsider at some point. In April 2019, the Cherry Hills Village City Council in Colorado voted unanimously to drop the name “Swastika Acres” from a subdivision.

Five Republican U.S. senators have urged Netflix Inc to reconsider plans to adapt a Chinese science-fiction book trilogy into a TV series because they said the author has defended the Chinese government's treatment of Uighur Muslims.The Three-Body Problem and two sequels were written by Chinese author Liu Cixin. Netflix announced earlier this month that it was turning the books into a live-action, English-language TV series led by D.B Weiss and David Benioff, the creators of HBO megahit Game of Thrones. Liu serves as a consulting producer on the project.In a letter to Netflix, the senators pointed to comments by Liu to the New Yorker magazine in 2019 about China's clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the Xinjiang region.“If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty,” Liu said. “If you were to loosen up the country a bit, the consequences would be terrifying.”The United States and human rights groups have criticised China's treatment of the Uighurs. Chinas foreign ministry has repeatedly denied the existence of internment camps in Xinjiang, calling the facilities vocational and educational institutions and accusing what it calls anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy.

U.S. President Donald Trump will accept the results of the election if it is free and fair, his press secretary said on Thursday, amidst a raging controversy on the President not committing himself to a peaceful transition of power in the case of a defeat in the November 3 polls.“The President will accept the results of a free and fair election. But I think that your question is more fitting to be asked of Democrats, who have already been on the record saying they will not accept the results of an election,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at her news conference.She was responding to a question seeking an assurance that there will be a peaceful transition of power. “I am referring to the President being asked if there would be a peaceful transfer of power and he did not say yes. So I am asking, will there be a peaceful transfer of power if he loses this election?” the reporter asked.

Take Trump seriously when he doesn’t commit to orderly transfer of power: Sanders




 “I believe that question asked by the Playboy reporter — in fact, I think have it right here — he (Trump) was asked win, lose or draw, whether he would accept the transfer of power. I am not entirely sure if he won, why would he accept a transfer of power. That is maybe the deranged wish of that reporter, but that is not how governing works,” Ms. McEnany said.She referred to several comments made by the Democrats in the past, apparently questioning the validity of an election.“South Carolina Democrat Jim Clyburn has said Trump is not going to win fairly. Senator Barbara Boxer has said the only way Trump will win is to steal it. That is according to Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer,” McEnany said.“The Washington Post has noted — they have a headline — ‘Democrats may not trust the results of the election if Trump wins’ And then you have that beautiful quote from Hillary Clinton that Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstance,” she said, adding that this is more a fitting question for the Democrats.“The President will accept the results of a free and fair election. He will accept the will of the American people,” Ms. McEnany said.The President, she said wants to get rid of the mass mail-out voting because “he has said clearly that that could go either way. It could damage either candidate’s chances because it is a system that is subject to fraud.”“In fact, in the last 24 hours, police in Greenville, Wisconsin found mail in a ditch and it included absentee ballots. And also, I can confirm for you that Trump ballots, ballots for the President, were found in Pennsylvania. And I believe you should be getting more information on that shortly. Here in the last 24 hours, they were found cast aside.”“The President has always made the distinction that absentee ballots, where you go through a process, where you request a ballot and you mail that in, that is a system that works,” the press secretary said.“But a system where you mass mail out to voter rolls, which are not kept and maintained, where in Los Angeles County, for instance, you have 120% of the county enrolled, that system is untenable. It does not work. It leads to what we saw in Nevada, where there were ballots languishing in trash cans and pinned to apartment boards,” she added.

 A vaccine for COVID-19 by the end of the year will be the fastest pace for a novel pathogen in history, the White House said on Thursday, asserting that it has been the goal of the administration and it is still on track for that. “We do expect to have a vaccine by the end of the year. That has always been the goal and we are still on track for that,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference in Washington. It is very important what US President Donald Trump has done with regard to commercial-level manufacturing, she said. “The fact that you have scaled up to manufacture these vaccines in advance is something that this president has done, as he is a businessman and thinks through exactly how to get a safe and effective vaccine delivered at a record speed. And part of that has entailed manufacturing in advance,” McEnany said. “To do this, it normally takes years to scale up to commercial-level production. But this president has done it in just a few short months. If we have this vaccine by the end of the year, it will be the fastest pace for a vaccine for a novel pathogen in history,” she added. In response to another question on the president’s suggestion a day before that he might overrule stricter standards at the FDA on the coronavirus vaccine, McEnany said the Food and Drug Administration does have strict standards. “They are the gold standard with regard to vaccines. The president was referring to the normal interagency process that happens with guidance and that includes running through the office of management and budget, so that is standard operating procedure,” she said. In a separate statement, Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, praised the president for his successful fight against the coronavirus. “President Trump has done an extraordinary job, fighting the made in China virus on all fronts every single day,” he said.

 A maximum of only 1,000 people will be allowed each day at Roland Garros after the French government insisted Thursday on tougher restrictions to counter the resurgence of the coronavirus.Organisers of the French Open, which gets underway four months later than planned in Paris on Sunday, had hoped for a maximum of 5,000.That figure had already been reduced from 20,000 and then 11,500.The decision by the French government will be a huge blow to Roland Garros which last year attracted on average around 37,000 fans a day.French Prime Minister Jean Castex, speaking on France 2 TV, insisted that the Grand Slam tournament must be subject to the same restrictions imposed Thursday on sports events taking place in designated ‘red zones’ where the coronavirus is showing signs of resurgence.“We will apply the same rules at Roland Garros as elsewhere,” said Castex. “We go from 5,000 to 1,000.”Sources told AFP, however, that the figure does not include credential holders such as officials, media, players and staff.Earlier Thursday, French Open chief Guy Forget said he had hoped to protect the 5,000 limit.“We still hope to have 5,000 spectators,” said the tournament director.Forget believed that the nature of the Roland Garros complex would work in the tournament’s favour.“We are able to accommodate 5,000, as small as it is, on a 12-hectare area,” he added.“Even if we must remain extremely careful, we have all the guarantees so that this tournament takes place in maximum security conditions.“We are responsible, but all this must be done with the approval of the government.” He added: “We stage the tournament on the equivalent of 15 football fields, outdoors. Everyone wears a mask, even the ball boys and girls and chair umpires.”The US Open in New York, which ended just under two weeks ago, banned all spectators from its sprawling Flushing Meadows complex.Wimbledon, meanwhile, was cancelled for the first time since the Second World War.

Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Thursday said the Centre’s agriculture sector Bills were primarily aimed at lifting the safety cover in the form of Minimum Support Price (MSP), thereby ruining the food growers of the country.Mr. Badal said Punjabis would not accept any such move that aimed to harm farmers’ interests, and the State government would vehemently oppose these attempts of the BJP-led Union government. “No one will be allowed to harm the interests of farmers at any cost. The agriculture Bills will deprive the farmers of a safety cover in the form of MSP,” said Mr. Badal.He said the ₹50 increase in MSP of wheat announced by the Centre recently was the least in the previous decade (only 2.6%). He said this was despite the fact that the Commission for Agriculture Cost and Prices (CACP) had recommended an MSP increase of 6% in the wake of 8.4% food inflation. “This is a pointer that the Union government is dragging its feet from giving due MSP to farmers,” said Mr. Badal.Highlighting the significance of MSP to farmers, the Finance Minister said that besides ensuring well being of food growers, it also acted as a catalyst in the State’s development. In Punjab, procurement of food grains worth ₹70,000 crore took place every year. Mr. Badal said the State received ₹3,900 crore mandi fees annually, which was used for maintenance, repair, and upkeep of 65,000 km of link roads, bridges, culverts, mandis, and other infrastructure.The Finance Minister said Punjab always borne the brunt of the BJP government’s anti-Punjab stance. “Special tax concessions to hill States, the GST regime, and now these agriculture Bills have broken the backbone of Punjab’s economy,” said Mr. Badal. The worst part was that the Shiromani Akali Dal had always been part and parcel of the BJP’s anti-Punjab tirade, he said.

Ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar, Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik) president and former MP Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav, released the party’s pratigya patra (election manifesto) on Thursday, promising a corruption-free State in six months among several other steps for time-bound development if his government comes to power. Earlier, before releasing the manifesto to media persons, Mr. Yadav claimed that he had filed an affidavit before a judicial magistrate in Patna stating that his party was willing to face legal action if it failed to fulfil any of the promises. “This is the first time in the political history of the country that a party has filed such an affidavit in court before releasing its manifesto… every promise made in the manifesto will be completed in a time-bound manner once my party forms the government in Bihar,” asserted Mr. Yadav.He said he would tender his resignation if his party failed to make Bihar corruption-free six months after coming to power. “CCTV cameras will be installed in every shop and household within one year to prevent crime… any person found outraging the modesty of a woman or girl will be punished within two weeks of the incident and there will also be a provision to delete the perpetrators’ names from the voters’ list,” he said. “Land acquisition will be done as soon as any industrialist expressed willingness to invest in the State…migration from the State will be stopped within two years,” he said. He also promised to set-up a film city in the name of the late Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The heavyweight leader from Kosi and Seemanchal (border) areas of northeast Bihar also promised a turnaround for the State in three years time. “It will be 3 years versus 30 years of RJD and NDA regime in the State,” he said. Within three years of his government coming to power, he would permanently solve the perennial flood problem. “I have a list of as many as 60 scams that happened during the last 15 years of NDA regime in the State…all of these will be investigated and the guilty will not be spared.”RLSP meetingMeanwhile, in another significant development, mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) partner Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) held its executive committee meeting in Patna on Thursday. It passed a resolution authorising party chief Upendra Kushwaha to take a decision on whether to remain with the alliance or make an exit on the seat-sharing issue. Party sources told The Hindu that RLSP may join the ruling NDA in the State soon. “There is complete lack of coordination in mahagathbandhan,” charged RLSP leader and party spokesperson Anand Madahv. “Politics is all about possibilities,” he said to a question whether the RLSP would join the NDA.

 U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed two executive orders on healthcare for Americans that lawyers said will carry little weight, as the president seeks to boost his flagging credibility with voters on the hot-button issue ahead of the November 3 presidential election.Mr. Trump signed the twin orders implementing his “America First Healthcare Plan” in an airport hangar in Charlotte, North Carolina, amid an audience that included medical professionals seated socially distanced and many wearing masks amid the coronavirus pandemic.“Under my plan 33 million Medicare beneficiaries will soon receive a card in the mail containing $200 that they can use to help pay for prescription drugs,” Mr. Trump said in describing part of his program.One of the executive orders is aimed at ensuring Americans with pre-existing conditions retain healthcare coverage, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters on Thursday, even as his own administration seeks to strike down the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which protects the same right.Mr. Azar also said Mr. Trump was directing him via the second executive order to work with Congress to pass legislation banning surprise healthcare bills by the beginning of next year, and explore executive action to address the goal if the legislative bid fails.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, labelled it a “bogus order,” as she called on the president to ”drop his lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act in the middle of a pandemic.”While Mr. Trump heralded his actions, some lawyers expressed skepticism that he had the authority to make the move via executive order.Nicholas Bagley, a professor at University of Michigan's law school, said: “Unless there's a law that prohibits the conduct in question, or unless the president is exercising a power that's been delegated to him by Congress, his statements have no more legal weight than a tweet.”“It's as if I was walking around with a memo that was titled ‘Executive Order,’ and claimed that the policy of the United States is that everybody gets a cheeseburger on Tuesdays,” he added.Mr. Trump lags Democratic rival and former Vice President Joe Biden in national opinion polls, especially on the question of who would better handle healthcare.The president's action, unveiled less than six weeks before Election Day on November 3, also comes amid long-standing criticisms that he has failed to follow through on promises to propose an alternative to Obamacare even as he works to dismantle that program.Trump also has drawn fire for his administration's response to the deadly coronavirus, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans.In June, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to invalidate the Obamacare law that added millions to the healthcare safety net.The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, prohibited health insurers from denying coverage to Americans with known health conditions.Surprise bills occur when patients visit a hospital they believe is in their health insurance network but then are seen by a doctor or specialist who is out of network. Trump previously called on Congress to address the issue in 2019.“What the president is saying is that all the relevant players - hospitals, doctors, insurance companies - had better get their act together, and get legislation passed through Congress that protects patients against surprise medical bills,” Azar said.

It draws blood from the heart and pumps into the body,"" said Kewal Krishan, Director, Heart Transplant & Ventricular Assist Devices, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket.""Left Ventricular Assist Device [LVAD] is a device that adds 13 to 15 years to the life of people facing imminent heart failure. It boosts functions of the heart and is used either as a temporary measure till a heart transplant can be conducted, or as a destination therapy where the patient lives with the device permanently as they are unfit for a heart transplant. LVAD enables patients to live a normal life even after end-stage heart failure,"" he added.LVAD costs between ₹45 lakh to ₹90 lakh, the doctor said. ""If you are doing a heart transplant then you will have to take medicines, which cost about ₹20,000-₹30,000 for the rest of your life. Also, the medicines are immunosuppressants, which will affect the kidney,"" Dr. Krishan said.""LVADs are mechanical pumps of the size of one’s palm and have a cable that connects to an outside chargeable battery unit. An impeller within the pump spins thousands of times a minute, circulating the blood around the body continuously without a break. This means that LVAD patients don’t have a pulse or heart beat or measurable blood pressure. The external components of LVAD include a controller and batteries which power the device,"" the hospital said.

The man said all the pictures were sent by the woman within three minutes of their conversation.On the same day, they had a telephonic conversation in which she allegedly invited him to her flat in Saket. After he went to her place, she allegedly asked him to get “some wine”. “Soon all the inhibitions were shed and hitherto normal text messages got mixed with flirtatious...and all the advances by the petitioner [man] in said direction were overly welcomed by the complainant [woman] and there was not an iota of any demur and/ or any protest,” the man’s plea said. The man alleged that the woman called him at her home and when her demand for ₹5,00,000 was not met, she registered a false case of rape against him.Claims of prosecution On the other hand, the case of the prosecution states that the woman had texted him for a job to which he had sent “offensive” replies.

Goa leads India in the per capita production of plastic waste in India at 61.2 gm per day, followed by Delhi and Chandigarh, said a report on the state of plastic waste by the Centre for Science and Environment released in Delhi on Thursday. Just seven States — Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh — generate two thirds of the country’s plastic waste.India’s national per capita plastic waste generation is 7.6 gm per day and the country, it is estimated, produces 3.3 trillion grams of plastic waste per year. These figures were based on numbers and estimates by the Central Pollution Control Board.Plastic waste comprises around 6% of India’s solid waste generation of 55-65 million tonnes.Almost 66% of plastic waste comprised of mixed waste — polybags, multilayer pouches used for packing food items sourced mainly from households and residential localities. These, according to the study, were plastic waste which could not be recycled.A global material balance study on plastics points out that 79% of the total plastics produced in the world enters our environment as waste. Only 9% of the total plastic waste in the world is recycled.“We had imagined that we had solved the problem of plastic waste through recycling it, or burying it, or shipping it out of our sight. But we were wrong. Plastic waste is everywhere today. It is in our faces. It is filling up our oceans and destroying marine life and even invading our food chain to get into our bodies. Our per capita use of plastics is growing — and as we become richer, we will end up generating more plastic waste,” Sunita Narain, CSE Director-General, said at a webinar at the release of the report.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India plans to eliminate the use of single use plastic and the government first committed to eliminating it by 2022 but then backtracked on the grounds that it would be too “disruptive” to the economy, the CSE report added.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) clarified in the Supreme Court on Thursday that their refund and credit shell policy for flights cancelled during the lockdown did not cover international flights originating from abroad.“The regulatory mechanism does not cover international flights which originate from any foreign destination... These flights are governed by the regulatory mechanism of the country of origin, irrespective of the fact whether the carrier is Indian or not... Refund of tickets/credit shells of international flights would be governed by the law of the sovereign country from where such flights originate,” the affidavit filed jointly for DGCA and the Ministry said.The Ministry was replying to questions raised by the airlines and the petitioner, Pravasi Legal Cell, represented by senior advocate Sanjay Hegde and advocate Jose Abraham. The case is scheduled to be heard on September 25.The affidavit clarified that neither the DGCA nor the Ministry have any role in the private arrangements made between travel agents and airlines for lump sum booking of air tickets in advance. These arrangements were made with an eye on private commercial gain. Regulators like DGCA had no role in such arrangements. The contract of purchase of such tickets did not come under the Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs).“This lump-sum payment of money by a travel agent or a corporate house on behalf of his client to the airlines, either in advance or after availing the flight services, is not recognised as a contract of purchase of tickets under the CARs. They remain in the realm of private contract between the parties. The CARs recognizes only those tickets, which are actually issued by the airline in the name of a known and identified traveller, who is either the client of the travel agent or an employee of a corporate house,” the affidavit clarified. Travel agents and tour operators had raised concerns over how they would be refunded for tickets they had booked in advance and in bulk for flights which were cancelled during the lockdown. The refund and credit shell proposal of the government only recommends payment of refund and opening of credit shells in the names of the passengers.

The Builders’ Association of India (BAI) has requested the Tamil Nadu government to reduce the stamp duty and registration charges to a maximum 4%, similar to States like Maharashtra and Karnataka. The construction industry has been hit due to the pandemic, the BAI said.BAI southern centre chairman L. Shantha Kumar said stamp duty in Tamil Nadu was the highest when compared to other States and it was a huge burden on the buyers who had to pay 11% stamp duty and registration charges. “All other States have cut down on stamp duty charges,” he said.Recently, the governments of Maharashtra and Karnataka reduced stamp duty and registration charges from 5% to 3% to boost their realty sector.The association also sought clearance of several bills due to contracts pending with various government departments.The BAI further sought the revision of water tax and sewerage charges, as per the rates in force prior to financial year 2018-19.“The water and sewerage taxes, that are being calculated according to annual rental value assessed by the Corporation of Chennai were not revised to earlier rates even after the government rolled back the hike in property tax in Chennai,” Mr. Kumar said. “The CMWSSB is not complying with the above orders and is still collecting water tax and sewerage charges in enhanced rates, ignoring the government orders,” he charged.The BAI favoures an online single-window system for local, DTCP and CMDA approvals similar to Telangana, which has adopted the “Telangana State Building Permission Approval and Self Certification System (TS-bPASS)”, that provides building permission approvals within 21 days without any hassles.

Senior Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh on Thursday termed the twin farm bills passed by Parliament as surgical strikes on farmers. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 passed by both Houses would help multinational companies access Indian rural agri-market, said Mr. Singh, addressing a press conference here. Amendments in labour laws were an assault on labourers while twin bills on farming were surgical strikes on peasants, he said. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi often accuses Congress of lying on minimum support price. Our demand is that his government should include MSP provisions in the law and make it illegal if a trader purchases farm produce below MSP. The intention of the government is to give billionaires entry into rural agri-market. So far the Indian agri-market has been controlled through government interventions,” said the veteran Congress leader. “The farm bills allow the Centre to control of Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) and small farmers will have to go to New Delhi for dispute resolution if dispute is not resolved at district level. Farmers cannot go to civil court,” he pointed out. Stating that contract farming provisions were against interests of farmers, Mr. Singh pointed out, “now, multinational companies can enter into contract with any farmers’ group. Farmers cannot sell their produce above the price mentioned in the contract.” “The Narendra Modi Government has come up with a contract farming which is similar to East India Company’s contracts against which Mahatma Gandhi had started campaign from Champaran. The multinational companies will ask farmers to sign exhaustive agreements which hardly any farmer could understand,” said Mr. Singh. Stating that the Narendra Modi government was under tremendous pressure from the WTO which advocates free trade, the Congress leader said, “Congress has been resisting this pressure. In 1993, the Congress government had clearly said India would never compromise with interest of small farmers and poor. We had told that our poor population was fighting against malnutrition and WTO cannot put pressure on us.” “Till 2013, the Indian government had not compromised on how much grain can be stocked up on this despite tremendous pressure. In 2015, BJP-led government compromised on this and gave permission on import of wheat and rice,” said Mr Singh. “When wheat and rice start coming from foreign, prices will drop. It will harm farmers,” he said.

Over 15 lakh applications had been received under the micro-credit scheme for street vendors, launched as part of the COVID-19-related economic package, of which 2 lakh loans had been disbursed, the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry said on Thursday. The PM Street Vendor’s AtmaNirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi), which provides street-vendors with loans up to ₹10,000 to restart their work after the lockdown, had sanctioned 5.5 lakh loans since it was rolled out on July 2, the Ministry said. “In order to expedite the loan sanctioning process and provide ease of operation to the lenders, it has been decided to push the applications directly to the bank branches, which have been indicated by the vendor as ‘preferred lender’ or where the vendor holds a savings bank account in case ‘preferred lender’ is not indicated. This process is expected to give boost to the number of loans sanctioned and cut down the time for loan disbursal drastically,” the Ministry said in a statement. A software for processing the applications in such a way had been developed, and about 3 lakh applications would be sent to banks using it, the Ministry said. It has estimated that the scheme could benefit 50 lakh vendors.

 In line with the Trump administration’s progressive restrictions on visas, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposed a rule on Thursday limiting the duration of initial admission for foreign media (I visas), students (F visas) and exchange visitors (J visas).The rule proposes fixed time periods and extension periods for the three visa categories which currently operate under the “duration of status” framework. Also read: Trump signs executive order against hiring H1B visa holders for federal contractsCurrently, visa holders in these categories are allowed to remain in the US for as long as the conditions of admission are met (for example, as long as an F visa holder is enrolled in a university and meeting other conditions). This rule, if finalised, will change that.Under the new proposed rule F and J students would be admitted for an initial period of four years only (the normal duration of an American undergraduate degree). However, the duration of stay will be two years for those from countries with visa-overstay rates greater than 10% and those non-US citizens either born in or holding citizenship of a country on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. F and J students already admitted will have their “duration of status” terms converted to a term ending with the end of their program (not to exceed four years) if and when the proposed DHS rule becomes final.Also read: Trump issues proclamation to suspend H-1B, other visas till year end“The significant growth of the F, J and I visa programs has necessitated this proposed update to ensure the integrity of the U.S. immigration system, but this rule does not propose changes to the underlying requirements to qualify for these nonimmigrant classifications,” a DHS press statement said.Foreign Journalists to be admitted for 240 days initiallyForeign media visa holders will initially be admitted for a period not exceeding 240 days with “an opportunity to extend their stay for a maximum of 240 days based on the length of relevant activities,” the statement said.

Sivaganga district has successfully cured 95.1% of the patients who had tested positive to COVID-19, said Deputy Director of Health Yasodamani here on Thursday.Between April and August, 4,576 pregnant women were screened and 298 among them tested positive. They were all treated for the infection and the babies were delivered safely. During the pandemic, 4,810 deliveries were performed in the district, Dr. Yasodamani told The Hindu. For the benefit of senior citizens who could not move out of home due to the pandemic, government doctors were available on mobile phone 93454 67903 for consultation, she said and added that downloading the eSanjeevani App had been beneficial to the needy. About 1,600 patients had used the the App so far, she said.Another official said that so far 77,133 people were screened in the district and 4,878 among them tested positive, which was 6.3 % of the total tests.Collector J Jayakanthan said that among the 10 districts in south Tamil Nadu, Sivaganga had been maintaining the 10th position till date with 297 active cases in hospitals till Wednesday.With swift test results made possible in the district's three testing machines, they had increased the testing from 700 to 1,500 persons in a day, Dr. Yasodamani said and added that in July, 19,605 people were tested and 1,830 of them were found positive. In August, 21,192 tests were taken and 1,035 tested positive and in September, 22,303 tests were taken and 479 turned out to be positive.Hence, the infection was on the decline. However, people must continue to take caution and stay indoors and use facemasks properly while going out. Using hand sanitisers and maintaining physical distancing would prevent COVID-19 from spreading, she said.

The Bombay High Court on Thursday allowed Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officer Bhagyavant Late to file their replies to a plea filed by actor Kangana Ranaut after the civic body demolished her bungalow in Bandra.Advocate Pradeep Thorat representing Mr. Raut and senior advocate Anil Sakhare appearing for Mr. Late sought time before a Division Bench of Justice S.J. Kathawalla and Justice R.I. Chagla to file their replies.Mr. Thorat said that he needed time to file an affidavit as Mr. Raut being an MP was in Delhi.The Bench, however, made a remark on the BMC seeking time to reply, and said, “You need more time here but otherwise you are very fast (in demolishing).”While allowing them time, the court said, “Since 40% of the petitioner’s (Ms. Ranaut) bungalow was already demolished on September 9 and the bungalow continues to stand in a partially demolished condition, it is likely that some mishap may be caused due to heavy rainfall in Mumbai. It is therefore necessary to hear the matter at the earliest.”The Bench thus directed senior advocate Birendra Saraf representing the actor to commence his arguments on September 25 at 3p.m..On September 9, the BMC undertook a drive to demolish alleged illegal portions of Ms. Ranaut’s office. Soon thereafter, the court had directed the BMC to stay the process of demolition.A stop work notice pertaining to substantial alterations and additions carried out unlawfully was issued by the BMC under Section 354A (power of designated officer to stop erection of building or work commenced or carried on unlawfully) of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act to Ms. Ranaut on September 8.

 Kings XI Punjab skipper KL Rahul, who scored a scintillating century against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Thursday, said he was lacking confidence in his skills as a batsman heading into the team’s second IPL fixture. Rahul starred with an unbeaten 132 off 69 balls as KXIP outplayed RCB by 97 runs. “I have actually been not so confident (hitting it this well). I had a chat with Maxi (Glenn Maxwell) yesterday, he said how are you feeling, I said that I am not feeling completely in control of my batting, he said you must be joking, you are hitting really well,” Rahul said at the post-match presentation. He had already spoken about his fears leading up to the IPL, considering he was coming back after a five-month long break due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Quite honestly I was nervous but I knew if I spend time in the middle, hit a few balls from the middle of bat, it will all settle down.  “I try to do (the same routines as I did when I was a player) but as a captain you have shortened time and you are running around and doing a lot of things,” Rahul said.  Rahul is captaining in the IPL for the first time.  “I still try to maintain the same routine. Once I am in the middle and during the toss is the only time I feel like a captain and otherwise I try to balance being a player and the captain,” he said. After Rahul starred with the bat, KXIP bowlers put a disciplined performance to bundle out RCB for 109 in 17 overs. “It’s as complete a team performance as it can get. We had few different plans going into this game.  “We knew RCB have a power packed batting line up and we had to get 2-3 wickets up front and that also meant putting runs on the board, we know what these guys can do if they get set. The analyst, coaches and the management will be happy.”  He was all praise for young leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi. “Something that has impressed me in him (Bishoni’s heart of coming back even after an expensive start). I watched the U-19 World Cup. He has a lot of fight in him.  “Every time I throw the ball he wants to do well, he was a little nervous bowling at guys like Finchy and AB, once he got through that he did well,” added Rahul. Kohli takes blame for dropping Rahul twiceRoyal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli had no qualms in taking the blame for dropping Kings XI Punjab skipper KL Rahul twice, which contributed significantly to their 97-run defeat here on Thursday. Kohli felt had he not dropped Rahul, who remained unbeaten on 132, twice KXIP would not have been able to go past the 200-run mark.“I have to stand in front and take the brunt of it, not the best day in the office, couple of important chances of KL when he was set and that cost us 35-40 runs at a later stage. Maybe if we restricted them to 180 we wouldn’t have been under pressure from ball one of the chase,” said Kohli at the post-match presentation. KXIP posted 206 for three and RCB were bundled out for 109 in 17 overs.“We know exactly where we went wrong and I have to put my hand up and say a couple of important chances went down. There are days when these kind of things happen on the cricket field, they happen and we have to accept them.“We have had a good game (against Sunrisers Hyderabad), we have had a bad game and now it is time to move on and learn from the mistakes we made,” said Kohli. On sending the young Josh Philippe ahead of himself at number 3, Kohli said: “He has batted at the top of the order for Western Australia and done well in the BBL as well, early days in the tournament so we thought we will maximise his ability and see how we go from there on. We thought we will give ourselves a bit of depth in the middle overs.” The Australian wicketkeeper-batsman had batted in the middle-order in RCB’s first game against Sunrisers. RCB next play defending champions Mumbai Indians here on September 28.

The Maharashtra Congress on Thursday asked whether the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had now been renamed as the NaMo Controlled Bureau as it was neglecting the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) angle in its investigations into the Bollywood-drug connection.The Congress also wanted to know to why the NCB was avoiding a probe against actor Kangana Ranaut on her video in which she has reprortedly confessed to consuming drugs. “While the NCB made such a huge ado over a 59 gram cannabis case, at the same time, BJP activist Chandrakant Chauhan was arrested in Karnataka with 1,200 kg of cannabis and the NCB didn’t even bother to look into the case,” State Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said. He said actor Ragini Dwivedi, a star campaigner of Karnataka BJP, was arrested in a drug case. “Aditya Alva too has been arrested. Mr. Alva is the brother-in-law of Gujarat BJP’s star campaigner, actor Vivek Oberoi, and Mr. Oberoi is the co-producer of the Modi biopic with Sandeep Ssingh. Mr. Oberoi is a partner in Mr. Singh’s production company,” Mr. Sawant said. The Congress leader pointed out that the alleged BJP-Bollywood-sandalwood-Goa drug connection was not being probed. Mr. Sawant said that the poster release of the Modi biopic was done in the presence of the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. “It is yet to be revealed whom Mr. Ssingh had called 53 times in the BJP office and who had helped him in a case in Mauritius. All these things are linked. The Maharashtra government has told the CBI about this. But to this day, this angle has not been investigated which is surprising,” Mr. Sawant said. “Even Ms. Ranaut is missing from the NCB’s drug connection probe. She has confessed that she was taking drugs. While her video is evidence of drug use, why isn’t she being questioned?” asked Mr. Sawant, pointing out that at a time when the NCB is calling people for an inquiry based on WhatsApp chats, it is turning a blind eye to Ms. Ranaut’s video.

The United Nations Millennium Development Goals and the World Bank Group’s global practices have recognised sustainability as an essential issue of global importance. Economic, social and other forms of sustainability have evolved over the years, but it is environmental sustainability that has gained significant popularity.Environmental sustainability is understood as buying greener products, avoiding hazardous materials, energy optimisation, and waste reduction. While some firms are still reluctant to engage in environmentally beneficial activities as they are afraid to compromise on the economic benefits, some others have positioned environmental practices at the forefront due to legislation, and industry and government commitments. In several firms, high importance has been given to environmentalism due to compelling regulatory norms, and a potential to manage costs, risks and optimise eco-friendly practices. However, in this process, organisations, especially in the manufacturing sector, get so serious about the low-hanging fruits of waste reduction and energy efficiency improvements that they fail to recognise the need for restructuring their learning imperatives and see the big picture of environmentalism. While government norms, organisational policies and corporate environmental responsibility projects drive environment-friendly practices, these are merely short-term actions towards environmental sustainability.Also read | Sand, a global sustainability challenge: UN reportLong-lasting benefitsOnly through organisational learning can people be urged to work towards long-lasting benefits. In this context, green supply chain practices are useful. These include green procurement, green manufacturing, green distribution, and reverse logistics. With practices starting from acquisition of eco-friendly raw material to disposal/ reuse/ recycle of used products,employees, suppliers, distributors, retailers and customers will be able to integrate environmental concerns in the daily operations of a firm. Thus, green supply chain practices enable organisational learning in environmental sustainability.Our research, based on a survey of 220 respondents across 21 manufacturing units in India, points to the inter-linkages between green supply chain practices, organisational performance and learning. We found that these inter-linkages not only lead to a long-lasting natural drive towards environmental performance, but also to higher economic performance . Research shows that the positive impacts of environmentalism can only be felt in the long term when they get embedded into organisational learning systems through green supply chain practices. The resultant learning system smoothens the knowledge flow in the organisation and help firms to strategise for better performance, bearing in mind the environmental aspects. This further promotes environmentalism across all players in manufacturing supply chains. Thus, environmental sustainability is ensured from the source (willingness) and not through force (regulations).Opinion | No, the lockdown is not a green momentUnderstanding linksDrawing linkages between green supply chain practices, corporate environmental performance, corporate economic performance and the dimensions of learning organisations in firms is necessary for an organisation’s progress and environmental protection in society. Understanding these inevitable links will enable managers and experts to shape their organisational values, work practices, and performances for the greater good of society.We infer that when the different players of a manufacturing supply chain realise the inherent benefits associated with organisational learning dimensions, their drive towards environmentalism increases. Policymakers should support this thinking by not merely imposing environmental practices as regulatory norms but by emphasising on the creation of green supply chain-based learning systems in manufacturing.Vijaya Sunder M. is Assistant Professor of Practice in Operations Management at the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad

Three farm bills — the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill (commonly referred to as the APMC Bypass Bill), and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill — were cleared by Parliament amid protests from the Opposition. Sudha Narayanan (Associate Professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research) and Arindam Banerjee (Associate Professor at the School of Liberal Studies at Ambedkar University) discuss the implications of the controversial Bills in a conversation moderated by Vikas Dhoot. Edited excerpts:What are the concerns about these Bills? Do they hold up?Sudha Narayanan: Sometimes we say, ‘Be careful what you wish for, you may actually get it’. These Bills represent fairly important changes in marketing regulation and are what many were asking for because of the flaws in the APMC [Agricultural Produce Market Committee] system. But at the same time, they are worrying for two reasons. The first is in what they say. The Bills have lacunae: lack of regulation, regulatory oversight and reporting. They’re somewhat non-transparent. The second is what they do not say. You can’t have marketing Bills that are devoid of the larger context of State intervention in agriculture, and agricultural policy.

Will the farm bills give farmers a choice? | The Hindu Parley podcast




 Could you give us examples of a couple of those?Sudha Narayanan: The APMC bypass Bill is the most controversial. This Bill actually assumes that private players don’t exist today and the APMC is a monopoly. That is a flawed assumption. Private players actually look to the APMC for a reference price to conduct their own transactions.Now you’re trying to create an alternative that’s outside the APMC, which is on advantageous terms where you don’t have to pay mandi fees or taxes. This could result in two perverse consequences. One is that the APMC continues to set the reference price. That makes no sense because if your private players are still looking to the APMC for a reference price, then your idea of getting rid of the inefficient APMC doesn’t hold. Large-scale trade outside the mandi is bound to happen because new players will prefer to trade outside the mandi because they don’t have to pay charges. APMC traders too might now prefer to operate outside the mandi for the same reason. So, if the APMC system collapses, then this Bill hasn’t envisioned any alternative for a large market that can actually set price signals. So, instead of unifying the national market, you could actually have little bargaining islands where people are just setting prices. This might undermine farmer interests. And in that new trade area, there is no regulation, no data, transactions are invisible. In the current APMC system, even with its flaws, at least there is some recording and grievance redressal. The current Bill leaves too much to the benevolence of private players to give fair terms to the farmers.Also read | Read farm Bills before stoking fears that farmers will suffer: Jal Shakti Minister tells OppositionArindam Banerjee: Private trade in agricultural commodities is not something new in India. At the same time, the justification for these Bills at this point of time is primarily, I think, to facilitate bigger private players into the farm sector. There are several reasons for that. The government’s justification is hinged on farmers getting better prices for their produce because they are going to get greater choices. Now, the farmers, at least the big farmers, and net surplus producers don’t seem convinced. The reason is that market prices or farmers’ incomes are not simply dependent on the market structure. Farmers’ organisations are concerned that other demands are being ignored, particularly during this difficult economic situation. Market prices are sluggish because demand is sluggish. Farmers’ incomes are actually seeing a period of stagnation. The other concern for farmers has been growing input costs. Farmers have been squeezed between rising costs of cultivation and sluggish prices. These concerns need interventions from the government in the form of subsidies or procurement. There is MSP [Minimum Support Price] and procurement but one major concern is that certain policy documents were presented before the government earlier, which talked about replacing the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and PDS with cash transfers.What might happen as a result of the facilitation of big players into the farm sector is that some farmers will get better choices and big farmers will actually start selling to the private players. There is a possibility that the importance of the APMC and the procurement system will actually wither away over time. And that concerns everybody.Also read | Congress made the same promises: Narendra Singh Tomar on farm billsThere is concern that big retail players and corporates could end up monopolising farm trade and vitiate farmers’ interests. What are the global precedents and can we learn something from there?Sudha Narayanan: Internationally, we’ve seen cartels. The French dairy producers and the dairy farmers’ co-operatives in the U.S. have become huge players. A lot of buyer cartels fix the price, and that’s one of the reasons the EU and the U.S. are taking a hard look at their own supply chains to reduce the power of consolidation.In India, it’s going to be less predictable, because big players themselves want to minimise costs. The traditional marketing channels are very resilient… if the farmer goes to a trader, it is for multiple reasons, not just the sale of crop. The trader extends credit, has a deeper relationship of trust and he will take all kinds of quality. The farmer runs a lot of risks dealing with the big players. It’s not a given that the big players will come in, set up shop and crowd out other players. But if they manage to get a place, there are two ways in which I have seen them operate. One is to try to crowd out competition and the other is to co-opt them. Big businesses are well positioned to interact with a lot of farmers because they have the field staff. But eventually, many of them end up co-opting farmer cooperatives or anybody who’s able to aggregate produce for them. So, though we keep saying that these Bills will facilitate direct transactions with farmers, what we are seeing is not dis-intermediation, but re-intermediation. Companies will find that it’s too expensive to work with a large number of farmers and look for intermediaries who will aggregate produce for them.Also read | In Punjab, farmers hold ‘rail roko’ against farm BillsArindam Banerjee: If you look at the global experience, corporate food markets are all about monopolies or duopolies. So, we can expect that to happen. But what I’m more concerned about is this: private trade in agricultural commodities has existed for several years in India, so what is the new usefulness from the perspective of big capital? Pepsi has been in the potato value chain and there are several other examples of contract farming. I think the new thrust area is the grain trade in India and that is where procurement by the government happens. I think global corporates are eyeing the grain market. With more than 90 million tonnes of foodgrain in our stocks, it is clear that there is a massive market to play around with, only if there is a relative shift of weight from government regulation to private players. Even with the pandemic measures, the stocks have not reduced. The pandemic has caused massive disruption of jobs globally. Consequently, it has caused a massive disruption for capital and profits as well. Agricultural goods have suffered less because these are necessary items in consumption baskets. There is less chance of revival of demand of industrial goods and services to pre-pandemic levels in the near future. This is why big capital is trying to move into the agricultural commodity trade on a bigger scale, so that it can recover some of its lost profits.Comment | It’s a no green signal from the farm worldWhile the Bills are said to give farmers more choices, shouldn’t they also have more predictable trade policies to work with? Every time prices rise, exports are curbed as we see with onions now.Sudha Narayanan: What you said is important. Look at what happened after these ordinances were passed. We had the ban on export of onions. So the farmers are not getting a signal that these Bills are, in fact, farmer-centric. There’s nothing in the Bills that says what the procurement policy is going to be. In general, when you want to protect the interests of the consumers, while not undermining the interests of the farmers, you have an array of policies that work together. You can’t say, I’m not going to use the Essential Commodities Act and then try to influence consumer prices by a policy that hurts farmers.Explainer | Why are the Agriculture Bills being opposedThe Opposition and some farmer groups want the MSP to be added to the legal framework so that they have a floor price of sorts. Is that some kind of a solution for now?Arindam Banerjee: The FCI was formed in 1965 as a response to a significant food shortage in the country. From that point, we have made progress in food production. In the early 1990s, we were not facing food shortages. That did not mean that the problem of hunger was addressed. It continues to persist because there is mal-distribution of foodgrain. And that is happening in spite of the PDS. One has to recognise that we have a different political-economic regime than the time the FCI was set up. Post-liberalisation, private players and capital have a much greater role to play in the economy, which is fine. But then you also need regulations for those players. So, if today there is a perceived concern about the government public procurement system, then it’s a valid demand to include a clause regarding procurement, or maybe just bring in another law that would quell a lot of fears.Also read | Why is govt. ‘running away’ from giving legal responsibility for MSP, asks CongressSudha Narayanan: Given that these Bills are quite problematic, I wouldn’t want an MSP clause to be introduced into them. If these Bills are flawed, we have to think of ways of fixing them. And I think the MSP question is larger, more complex, and deserves a very serious consultative process, and its own dedicated Act. Now the two may not be compatible. Because you can’t say I want to get private players but insist what price they deal with. That’s going to be self-defeating both for the MSP as well as for private participation. The reason MSP has to be a separate question is because farmers from Punjab may disagree with farmers from Bihar. So, how are you going to enforce the MSP? There have been interesting suggestions there. One suggestion was, if the APMCs were functioning as they would under the old regime, then you would ensure that all bidding starts at the MSP, which ensures that the MSP starts as a floor price. We’ve lost that opportunity now because now if you say APMC has a MSP, but outside it, you can do whatever you want, then it makes no sense any more.If we keep an MSP that actually forces the government to procure way more than it needs (like China did a decade ago and could not distribute it within the country or export it), then unless you have a very well-planned distribution system, does it make economic sense for the government? Who is going to take responsibility, and how is it going to be geographically distributed and across crops? So, even if you were to go for an MSP legislation, there needs to be serious discussion on all these different aspects.Also read | Government should bring in another Bill or amend current one, says RSS-affiliate SJMIs there any scope for course corrections in these Bills?Arindam Banerjee: There cannot be minor tweaks; major corrections need to be done. The consultative process that was missing within our federal democratic structure... at least some amount of that needs to be done. I may sound like an alarmist, but on the face of it, if these Bills undermine the grain procurement system, there could be Balkanisation of the country. It’s not simply a matter of farmers anymore, it’s a much deeper concern.Arindam Banerjee is Associate Professor at the School of Liberal Studies at Ambedkar University; Sudha Narayanan is Associate Professor at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research

The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the State government to grant 30 more days of ordinary leave to former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case life convict A.G. Perarivalan, who was already granted 60 days of leave between November 5, 2019, and January 11 this year. Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan disposed of a habeas corpus petition (HCP) filed by his mother T. Arputham and ordered relaxation of the prison rules, which do not permit a convict to avail ordinary leave within two years from the date when the previous leave had expired. Medical complications The orders were passed considering several medical complications suffered by Perarivalan and the fact that he was under incarceration for the past 29 years. The judges also took note that the convict had been granted 60 days of leave in 2017 also, and his conduct was found to be satisfactory. The judges further ordered notice to the State government on a sub-application preferred by Ms. Arputham seeking a copy of the Raj Bhavan’s reply to the government on the status of a recommendation made by the Cabinet to release all seven life convicts in the case. During the hearing of the HCP, the public prosecutor had informed the court that though the State Cabinet had made the recommendation on September 9, 2018, the Governor was awaiting the report of the Multi Disciplinary Monitoring Authority (MDMA) before taking a call on the issue. The MDMA was constituted pursuant to the Jain Commission of Inquiry to probe into the larger conspiracy behind the assassination.

The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) has cancelled the licence of the quarry at Illithodu, where two migrant workers were killed in a blast at an unauthorised storage of detonators on Monday. The licence for possession, sale, and use, which is issued by PESO, was cancelled under the provisions of the Explosives Rules, 2008. Two migrant workers from Salem in Tamil Nadu and Chamarajanagar in Karnataka were killed in the explosion. A preliminary report filed by the Controller of Explosives, PESO, Kochi, had said that the detonators were stored in an unauthorised building. The ‘magazine’ (building or structure intended for storage of explosives) as per the Explosives Rules approved by PESO was located 3 km away from the quarry. The explosives were found stacked in a building used to accommodate quarry workers. Senior PESO officials pointed out that it was a common practice among quarry managements to store explosives in temporary spaces close to the sites. “Explosives are often stored in such unauthorised spaces for convenience. Those entrusted with the job may act on their own or under directions from above to keep the detonators in unauthorised buildings,” they said. The rules make it clear that no person should receive from or transfer explosives to anyone for temporary storage or safe custody on licensed premises without prior approval from the Controller of Explosives or the licensing authority concerned. The magazine used for storage of explosives has to maintain a safety distance of 45 metres from nearby buildings. The building approved for storage should have walls built of rock, stone, or concrete conforming to the Indian Standards (IS). The building near the quarry site had a total carpet area of around 1,200 sq.ft. It was meant to house workers and store their personal belongings. The investigating officials were not able to assess the exact quantity of explosives at the unauthorised space, as it was completely destroyed in the blast. An estimate of the quantity of explosives used can be ascertained after verification of permission given by the Director General of Mines Safety under the Mines Act, they said.

The mystery of a ‘missing’ 33-year-old female patient from the newly-operational jumbo COVID-19 facility in the city’s College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP) grounds has sparked outrage among social outfits and activists. The patient, who had first tested positive on August 28 and had been admitted to the jumbo facility in the early morning of August 30, has not returned home since. Neither the staff at the facility nor the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) administration have the slightest clue of her ‘disappearance’. On Thursday, the Republican Yuva Morcha (RYM), an Amedkarite outfit, staged a protest outside the CoEP facility along with the woman’s kin, demanding a probe against errant officials. “A patient has been missing for 25 days and the hospital staff have no record. The administration has been cheating the woman’s mother by falsely claiming that the girl was admitted to the CoEP facility and was undergoing treatment. Now, the PMC is conveniently shifting blame on Lifeline — the former contractor that was tasked with the management of the facility,” Rahul Dambale, president, RYM, said. The woman had first gone to the COVID-19 facility in the city’s Balewadi but was referred to the Sassoon General Hospital as the former was full. As the latter hospital, too, was full to capacity, she was admitted to the CoEP facility on August 30. Two weeks later, when the patient’s mother, Ragini Gambire, visited the jumbo facility to collect her daughter, she was faced with an array of bewildering answers regarding her daughter’s presence in the facility. “When I visited the centre on September 13, the staff had no clue as to where she was. I was first told she was not in her bed and that she would be discharged later in the day. Then, the staff said that they could not find her. We searched for her on the hospital’s premises,” said Ms. Gambire, who lodged a missing person complaint at the Shivajinagar police station on September 14. The PMC's deputy municipal commissioner Rajendra Muthe said as per records of the jumbo COVID-19 hospital, the woman had been given discharge on September 5. “We have the hospital’s CCTV footage till September 4 in which the patient’s movement inside the facility is seen. We are in the process of handing over all the records and footage to the police for investigation,” Mr. Muthe said. Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Dambale lashed out at the apathy and ineptness of the PMC authorities, questioning as to why it had taken so long for the PMC to hand over the CCTV footage to the investigating authorities. “Until two days, PMC additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal, who is in charge of the jumbo facilities, was claiming that the patient was being treated there. Now, the authorities flip-flop and say she had been discharged on September 5. What kind of irresponsibility is this? Is it not the responsibility of the PMC to ensure that she was sent back to her home in an ambulance?” he questioned. Mr. Dambale said that it was inconceivable that a mega COVID-19 facility, set up with ₹200 crore of the taxpayers’ money, had no proper records of its patients. “So, who were the security in-charge? Ideally, the police should file a kidnapping case in this matter and the probe must be led by an officer of the assistant commissioner of police rank,” he said, adding that the RYM was planning to move the Bombay High Court soon if the PMC authorities did not make a clean breast of things. Criticising the PMC’s lacklustre management, Pune City Congress spokesman Ramesh Iyer said: “First, more than 40 patients succumb within 12 days in the CoEP jumbo facility because it is being operated on half-capacity, without requisite trained staff. Now, a woman goes missing. This is shocking and shameful.” He said that the administration’s claims of streamlining operations at the facility had proved hollow, as authorities had made no arrangements of keeping relatives updated as to the condition of their patients. The 800-bed critical care CoEP has been in the eye of a storm ever since it commenced operations late last month, with more than 40 deaths reported within the first fortnight itself, along with complaints pertaining to the alleged insensitivity of the medical staff.

The mood was sombre in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday as it had to take up obituary reference twice on the same day. While the House paid tributes to Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi in the morning, it took up obituary reference again in the evening as MLA for Basavakalyan B. Narayan Rao died.Both the leaders succumbed to COVID-19. Just a few days ago, Rajya Sabha member Ashok Gasti died of COVID-19.Elected representatives succumbing to COVID-19 has caused concern, and senior Congress member K.R. Ramesh Kumar appealed to Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri to direct the government to prevent large-scale weddings.“Though there is a restriction on the number of people who can attend weddings, in reality several of them are seeing attendance of more than 500 people. Even beegara oota (feasts organised a day after wedding) is being attended by more than 500 people. This has to be curbed,” Mr. Kumar said. He pointed out that there is often compulsions on local legislators to attend such events.He urged the government to direct the Deputy Commissioners and the Superintendents of Police to ensure that there is a thin attendance at weddings.Meanwhile, members, cutting across party affiliations, paid rich tributes to Mr. Rao. Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said Mr. Rao, who hailed from the oppressed community of Koli Samaj, had come up the ladder through hard work. He remembered how Mr. Rao had travelled all the way from Bidar to Bengaluru on a bicycle as part of a jatha.Bandeppa Kashempur of the JD(S) recalled that it was Mr. Rao’s dream to become an MLA once to raise the issue related to problems of his community who were still unable to find a firm financial footing.

A section of farmer organisation activists on Thursday staged a protest against Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) M. Rajeevan at Thamarassery, alleging that the Forest Department was cold-shouldering farmers’ concerns over the classification of buffer zones around the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary. The DFO who had planned to visit a few project areas to convince people’s representatives of the exact boundary of the buffer zones dropped it in the course of the protest. “I withdrew from the move, as any public protest on this issue would end up in the violation of the COVID-19 protocol. If they [protesters] are not interested in discussing the issues, we are helpless,” he told reporters on Thursday.The DFO also clarified that the proposed buffer zones would in no way affect the inhabited areas of Kattippara and Puthuppadi villages as propagated by a section of people. “If there is any concern, it should be addressed through proper channel, and the department is ready to hear the issues. Now, it is time such concerns were resolved,” he pointed out.Meanwhile, the protesters who shouted “DFO go back” slogans alleged that the Forest Department was trying to cover up the actual impact of the new regulations. They also complained that senior department officials were disinclined to hold discussions in the presence of those who were well-informed of the new regulations.

The Congress on Thursday urged the government to set up a commission under a Supreme Court judge or special investigation team under the Chief Justice of the High Court to probe what it termed a “mega corruption scandal in BDA that has shocked the State”.Moving an adjournment motion in the Legislative Council, Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil alleged that the party had evidence in terms of bank transactions, WhatsApp chat, and telephonic conversations to show that bribe had changed hands in the ₹666.22- crore housing complex work being executed by the BDA.“We believe the staff at the Chief Minister’s office and home office are involved in the case. So, we are demanding a high-level inquiry,” he added.Further, Mr. Patil alleged that a former BDA Commissioner had received ₹12 crore as bribe following which, he was transferred while ₹7 crore came as bribe through RTGS transfers from Kolkata-based shell companies to an individual named Shashidhar. “The State government should initiate action against the former BDA Commissioner under the Prevention of Corruption Act,” he urged.While Mr. Patil was making submission to move the motion, the BJP led by Ayanur Manjunath and others took objection, and urged Chairman K. Prathapchandra Shetty to reject the motion. Raising technical points, they said an adjournment motion cannot be moved without completing Question Hour and Zero Hour. A war of words ensued between the ruling and the Opposition benches before the Chairman intervened and allowed Mr. Patil to speak.Eventually, the Chairman ruled that the issue would not be taken up as adjournment motion but converted as discussion under the Rule 330 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Karnataka Legislative Council.

The alleged flaws in the classification of buffer zones by including huge swathes of agricultural land around the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary have triggered widespread protest among farmers in 13 villages in Kozhikode and Wayanad districts. An indefinite stir is likely to be launched soon under a new action committee formed by farmers’ organisations under the Kozhikode-based Karshaka Raksha Samiti. To begin with, farmers will take out a rally on September 28 seeking the withdrawal of the latest notification on buffer zones. With the objective of mobilising public support for the cause, the march will cover all the 13 affected villages. It will conclude at Adivaram on September 29. Farmers from Wayanad too will join the rally.Meanwhile, the committee will ensure mass participation by youth in the rally and subsequent agitations. Besides, religious and political leaders will address protesters.According to the committee, life of rural farmers will turn miserable with the “unscientific delineation” of buffer zones. In the Malabar region, it will mainly affect farmers at Chembanoda, Chakkittappara, Changaroth, Perambra, Koorachundu, Kanthalad, Puthuppadi, Kedavoor, Kattippara, Thariyod, Pozhuthana, Achooranam and Kunnathinadu villages, it claimed.Baby Perumalil, a leader of the committee, said any expansion of the buffer zones by grabbing farmers’ land would be opposed through united protests. “If implemented, the new buffer zone regulations will send out thousands of underprivileged farmers from their own land. Many of them are already facing wild animal attacks, fall in prices of agricultural produce, and loan burdens,” he argued.Committee leaders claimed that the conservation of the Malabar Wildlife Sanctuary could be ensured by scientifically marking the existing boundary of the forest land. Instead, there is a deliberate attempt to capture farm lands and evacuate farmers, they complained.According to them, the Revenue authorities are also working in favour of the Forest Department’s action plan. As part of suspicious attempts to convert farm land into forest land, even land tax is not being accepted from some landholders in Vilangad and Puthuppadi villages, they alleged.

The Madras High Court on Thursday came down heavily on the Directorate of Medical Education (DME) for having given away on a “platter” about 100 post-graduate medical seats, which were filled by private medical colleges under the management quota with less meritorious candidates this year. Justice N. Anand Venkatesh expressed anguish over the “attitude” of the DME and its Selection Committee in not having taken proper steps to conduct mop up counselling for management quota seats and instead having permitted the colleges to fill them up on their own. “This may perfectly suit the private colleges but then it is done at the cost of overlooking merit,” the judge said and pointed out that meritorious candidates had lost the chance of being accommodated in better courses because of the failure to conduct mop up counselling on time. The observations were made while passing interim orders on a writ petition filed by M. Keethanjali, who scored 524 marks in National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for PG admissions and was allotted M.D. (Microbiology) in regular counselling held in May. No mop up counsellingShe wanted to take up M.D. (Paediatrics) during the mop up counselling process but it was never conducted. Instead the seat was given to another student, who had scored just 298 marks in NEET, on the basis of permission given by the DME to private colleges to fill up the seats. “At some stage, this court has to ensure that similar instances do not occur in future. There must be a mechanism to ensure that the selection process takes place strictly in accordance with the Medical Council of India regulations and guidelines issued by the Supreme Court.” “The respondents cannot be allowed to create a situation and thereafter water down the selection process, which ultimately results in less meritorious students getting the seats and private colleges profiteering from the same,” the judge said. He sought an explanation from the DME by October 15 for not having filed a petition in the Supreme Court on its own for extension of the last date for medical admissions this year so that mop up counselling could be conducted and meritorious students could be admitted. Petition in SCThe judge pointed out that the DME had filed such a petition in the Supreme Court only after he directed it to do so but that application ended up being dismissed. He pointed out that other States had filed such applications on time and obtained extension of time. He also wanted the DME to explain why it had permitted private colleges to fill up seats that were declared vacant after the regular counselling to be filled up with candidates other than those who had already been allotted seats in the regular counselling process. The judge also wanted to know all details, such as names of candidates who were allotted seats in management quota seats of private colleges after grant of such permission by the DME, their NEET scores, the branch of medicine allotted to them and the name of the institution. He wanted the details to be submitted on October 15 for passing further orders.

The wait for the restoration of Adambakkam lake continues. With the waterbody remaining neglected for nearly a decade now, residents want it restored to prevent flooding in the surrounding localities.Residents of Adambakkam and Nanganallur complained that the waterbody was covered with vegetation. Spread over nearly 14 hectares, Adambakkam lake is one among a group of waterbodies that has surplus water draining into the Pallikaranai marshland.It is one of the three lakes, including Perumbakkam and Vengaivasal, chosen for the eco-restoration project at a cost of ₹12 crore with funds from the Environment Management Agency of Tamil Nadu. The Water Resources Department (WRD) planned to restore the original storage capacity, strengthen the bund and improve the lake with recreational facilities at a cost of ₹3.5 crore. Progress stalledHowever, residents noted that the work carried out, including the walkers’ path, were stopped earlier this year. There is a threat of flooding in areas such as Adambakkam, Thillai Ganga Nagar and Nanganallur during the oncoming northeast monsoon. V. Rama Rao, chairman of Sabari Green Foundation, said the lake had already shrunk and any delay in the project could lead to further encroachments. Desilting would lead to an increase in groundwater level. Residents of Adambakkam charged that the process of removing encroachments from the lake had been dragging for over a decade now due to inaction of the Revenue Department and the WRD. J.S. Augustine David, president, Federation of Adambakkam Welfare Associations, recalled that a similar project chalked out in 2014 was shelved for want of funds. “Our office bearers too gave suggestions for developing lake as a recreational space. Encroachments removal continues to be a problem and we had planned to file a public interest litigation for clearing encroachments and rejuvenation of the lake. There is an urgent need to desilt, deepen and fence the water body,” he said.However, the Water Resources Department listed out various challenges, including plugging sewage outfalls, that delayed the project. There was also a delay in getting funds. Officials said work was in progress to provide a flood regulator. “We are waiting for revenue authorities to verify the documents of the encroached structures to proceed with eviction,” an official said.

Instead, it is supporting the BJP. Today, when the State’s interests are being harmed by the BJP, which is usurping more power every day and infringing on the State’s rights, the State’s powers are being diminished. Tomorrow, everything will be under the BJP’s control if this continues.” ‘Giving to corporates’Mr. Rao said the three Bills were among the many attempts by the BJP to give away everything to corporates in the country.He said contrary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claims that Minimum Support Price for farmers would be ensured, MSP would in fact collapse. “The agriculture markets will collapse. States will lose their revenue and farmers will fall into a vicious cycle of having to accept the price paid by private individuals for their produce. The Bills will only lead to more and more contract farming in the country,” Mr. Rao warned.

The Tamil Nadu Idol Wing-CID seized a huge cache of ancient panchaloha and stone idols, which were stocked on the premises of a Puducherry businessman, on Thursday.Armed with a search warrant from a court, R. Sakthivel, Superintendent of Police, Idol Wing, and 15 personnel began the search at 10 a.m. in the ancestral house of Jean Paul Rajarathinam on Roman Rolland Street, which is located opposite the Department of Art and Culture, Puducherry.Of the total 74 idols, 60 are of antique bronze and 14 of stone, which were suspected to be stolen from temples in Tamil Nadu. They could be worth several crores of rupees. Rajarathinam is the brother of Marie Therese Anandi Vanina, 37, a French woman of Indian origin, whose house on Frederic Ozanam Street, Colas Nagar, Puducherry, was raided in 2016 by the Idol Wing and 11 antique bronze idols, worth several crores of rupees, were seized. Her husband Prabakaran was cited as an accused in the case and she was arrested by the Idol Wing-CID in August 2019 in Chennai on the charge of illegally exporting stolen antique idols and artefacts for several years from Puducherry to France.A senior officer of the Idol Wing told The Hindu, “Following the dismissal of a case instituted by Rajarathinam in the Madras High Court claiming ownership of these idols, we formally obtained a warrant from a jurisdictional court and seized all these idols illegally stored here. These idols are meant only for worship in Hindu temples.”According to the police officer, Rajarathinam claimed that his grandfather Joseph De Condappa was interested in collecting antique idols of various deities, and he had acquired them from Sambasiva Sthapathi between 1956 and the 1970s. Rajarathinam and Vanina had a running dispute over the idols. His grandfather had obtained a registration certificate from the competent authority under the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act, 1972.“There were no relevant records to justify that they were bought legally, and had genuine ownership. One could not obtain antiquity certificates in the 1970s for idols which were bought or made between 1956 and the 1970s. The son of Sambasiva Sthapathi told us his father did not make these kind of idols,” the senior officer said. Sources said all the recovered idols would be produced before a court in Kumbakonam. On the orders of the court, they would be restored to the temples to which they belong.

The Madras High Court on Thursday relaxed restrictions imposed on physical hearing of cases in all trial courts across the State due to the threat posed by COVID-19. It enhanced the number of cases that could be listed and heard by every trial court from 10 to “at least” 20 a day from Monday. The Administrative Committee, comprising top seven judges of the High Court, also permitted the entry of litigants as well as advocate clerks on the court campuses. The courts were allowed to let the accused surrender and entertain sureties by permitting them to enter the courts. The decision was taken after most of the principal district judges in the State informed the Administrative Committee of unsatisfactory response to physical hearing from the lawyers because of the prohibition on the entry of litigants on the court campuses. The committee, comprising Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justices Vineet Kothari, R. Subbiah, M. Sathyanarayanan, N. Kirubakaran, M.M. Sundresh and T.S. Sivagnanam, interacted with the principal district judges through video conferencing before taking the decision. Separate time slots It, however, ordered that separate time slots should be assigned for the appearance of litigants and sureties in order to avoid overcrowding and to maintain physical distancing norms. The restrictions were not relaxed for the taluk court in Thriuthiraipoondi alone due to certain concerns. Similarly, the Administrative Committee refused to relax the restrictions with respect to the courts in Puducherry and Karaikal, since the Chief Judge of the Union Territory reported that the death rate due to COVID-19 had increased. The committee further resolved that a decision on opening bar association rooms, lawyers’ chambers and canteens in the court complexes would be taken after assessing the functioning of the courts with relaxed restrictions. It further instructed the judicial officers across the State to ensure that service of summons and court notices were done by bailiffs and process servers using the NSTEP mobile app that had been provided in smartphones issued to them recently.

Observing that the effectiveness of herbal concoction kabasura kudineer, a Siddha formulation for boosting immunity, had been recognised even on the floor of the Parliament, the Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Centre to popularise it across the country. Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan also directed the Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) to come up with a roadmap on establishing at least one hospital per State for promoting all kinds of Indian systems of medicine. The directions were issued after they expressed displeasure over the Ministry giving more importance to the promotion of Ayurveda, and not Siddha and Unani. The judges wanted all forms of medicines to be promoted equally across the country, without restricting them to specific regions. They found that many posts in the cadre of adviser, joint adviser, deputy adviser, assistant adviser and medical officer had been sanctioned in the Ayurveda stream, and most of these posts had been filled up. Vacancies in the Ayurveda stream were relatively less. On the other hand, fewer posts had been sanctioned in the Siddha and Unani streams, and a majority of those posts were vacant, the senior judge on the Bench said, wondering why Ayurveda alone was being treated as the “blue-eyed boy” of the Centre. ‘Restricted to T.N.’ Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan responded to this by stating that Ayurveda was being practised in most parts of the country, whereas Siddha was restricted to Tamil Nadu and parts of border States such as Kerala and Andhra Pradesh. He added that proposals had been sent recently to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for filling all vacancies. Not convinced with the submission, the judges observed that it was the duty of the Centre to promote Siddha across the country, without any restrictions. The judges suo motu impleaded the UPSC as one of the respondents to a case before them and directed it to explain by November 1 as to when it would be commencing the recruitment process by calling for applications and conducting written examinations. The interim orders were passed on a habeas corpus petition filed against the detention of Chennai-based Siddha hospital administrator K. Thiruthanikachalam under the Goondas Act for releasing a video on social media accusing the government of ignoring his suggestions on treating COVID-19.

The Madras High Court on Thursday warned Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) secretary S.K. Dutta of being imposed with costs if he does not explain by October 5 as to why the board withdrew a circular issued on August 6 for closure of all slaughter houses across the country during the Jain festival ‘Paryushan Parva’. Justices Vineet Kothari and Krishnan Ramasamy recorded their displeasure over the counsel representing AWBI and Mr. Dutta seeking time repeatedly to comply with the order passed by the court on August 19. Granting them a final opportunity, the judges said such repeated adjournments amount to delaying the court proceedings.It was while passing interim orders on a public interest litigation petition filed by the Madurai North Indian Welfare Association, represented by its president J. Hukamsingh, that the court found that AWBI had issued a circular to all States on August 6 for closure of slaughter houses but withdrew the instructions on August 11. Surprised why the circular was withdrawn, the judges suo motu included AWBI and Mr. Dutta as respondents to the case and directed them to file an affidavit explaining the reasons for withdrawing the circular. They were also ordered to produce records to show who approved the withdrawal.

With the northeast monsoon ahead and the pandemic around, the district administration has drawn up an action plan to contain any outbreak of vector-borne diseases, particularly dengue and chikungunya. Though the figures available for the last nine months for both the vector-borne diseases show that cases during the period were less than those recorded during the corresponding months last year, the administration does not want to take a chance as a spike in dengue cases happens during the October-December period.Last year, Puducherry recorded as many as 2,038 cases of dengue and around 797cases of chikungunya. So far this year, the region had reported, 564 dengue and 254 chikungunya cases. District Collector-cum-Secretary (Health) T. Arun, who convened a meeting to review preparedness to deal with dengue on Wednesday, told The Hindu that the administration had decided to observe Friday as “dry day”. On the day, coolers, flowerpots, birdbaths, water containers, stagnated water and other possible breeding grounds for Aedes mosquitoes responsible for transmitting dengue would be kept dry, he said. “We appeal to the public, residents’ associations, non-governmental organisations and educational institutions to actively participate in the dry day. We need to contain the spread of dengue all the more now because of the pandemic. The mortality will be high if we have vector- borne diseases also,” he said. The administration also planned to take massive cleaning and awareness programmes at containment zones at Kalapet, Sholai Nagar, Ariankuppam, Mettupalayam, Moolakulam, Oulgaret and Vanarapet areas. “I have also given clear instructions to Public Works Department and Local Administration Department to clear all drains before the onset of monsoon,” the Collector said.

Justifying the assertion made by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam that the protest planned by the Congress against the farm bills in the Union Territory would be counter-productive in containing COVID-19, Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Thursday said, “The MLA is right. This is clear undermining of the joint hard work being put in to contain the COVID spread.” Responding to the letterby AIADMK floor leader A. Anbalagan, seeking action against Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy for calling an agitation against the Centre on September 28, the Lieutenant Governor, in a WhatsApp message, said: “Disturbing the recovery by doing agitations will be highly detrimental and ill- timed.”Joint efforts by ICMR, medical teams, officials and law enforcement agencies had led to a reduction in the positivity rate in the U.T., the Lt Governor said. Earlier in the day, Mr.Anbalagan, in a letter to the Lt. Governor, had sought action against the Chief Minister for calling the agitation. The Chief Minister who heads the State Disaster Management Authority would be violating the provisions of Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Act if he intended to participate in the agitation. “I appeal to the Lt.Governor to immediately intervene and initiate action against the Chief Minister,” Mr.Anbalagan said. He also appealed to the Union Home Minister to keep the Narayanasamy-led government on “suspended animation” for planning the agitation.

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday questioned the basis for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to praise Tamil Nadu’s efforts at combating COVID-19 and said that perhaps a discrete assessment by the Intelligence Bureau would bring out the ground reality.In a statement issued here, he said Mr. Modi, who on Wednesday praised Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for his handling of the pandemic, might get to know the truth about the State’s efforts and “the various scams in the procurement of medical equipment” if he conducted a discrete assessment by the Intelligence Bureau.People’s welfare “I hope the Prime Minister is really interested in the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu. If that is the case, he should take a broad view of the issue, instead of looking at it through the prism of the BJP’s alliance with the AIADMK, and see the truth for what it is — the State government’s massive failure in handling the pandemic, the doldrums the State’s economy is in, the unemployment in the State, the dissatisfaction of the middle class with the AIADMK government, the State’s fiscal deficit and the maladministration in the government, among other issues,” Mr. Stalin said.The Leader of the Opposition said he wondered what the Chief Minister had done that warranted a certificate of appreciation from Mr. Modi. Listing statistics related to the pandemic and the deaths it had caused, Mr. Stalin said he wondered if the Chief Minister had given Mr. Modi the right information.“Just like how the BJP government at the Centre is a ‘no-data’ government, the Tamil Nadu government is either a ‘no-data’ government or a government that hides the real numbers. Afraid of disclosing the real number of COVID-19 deaths, the State government is providing false data and is hiding the truth from the people,” he said.

A report prepared by the State Performance Audit Officer on the delay in constructing a 12-storey housing tower at Thuruthy in West Kochi for landless beneficiaries in the area, holds the Mayor, Additional Secretary, and the Superintending Engineer of the Kochi Corporation accountable for having violated rules and returned the security deposit to the contractor before completion of work.The Additional Secretary had then been holding the Secretary’s charge and had approved the return of the deposit after the Mayor had given her assent, according to the report.The corporation must take time-bound action to retrieve the deposit from the contractor, and till then, it remains the joint liability of the Mayor, Additional Secretary, and the Superintending Engineer, the report says.The construction of two such towers for 398 families initiated under the previous UPA government’s Rajiv Awas Yojana (RAY) has remained stalled for nearly three years now. The report says that 29 councillors had submitted a complaint on the matter before the Minister for Local Self-Governments, after which the audit officer had investigated it in October last year. A few Opposition councillors in the corporation had recently procured a copy of the report.After the security deposit of ₹91.22 lakh was returned to the contractor in June last year with the Mayor’s anticipatory approval, Opposition councillors have, since then, consistently disputed the return of the deposit without the council’s approval. When the issue was brought up again before the council at a meeting last month, it was put to vote and passed with the UDF’s majority in the council, Mayor Soumini Jain said.“Anticipatory approval can be granted by the Mayor in emergency situations, according to rules. The contractor wrote to us, saying he had no more money to spend and required the security deposit to prevent the work from coming to a halt. This letter was sent to the finance standing committee, where it was not opposed,” Ms. Jain said. While she has not seen a copy of the report, in this matter of social importance, she is willing to be held liable, she added.While payment worth around ₹10 crore had been made to the contractor, a site inspection revealed that only the ground floor and parts of the first floor were constructed, the report says. The cost of work done has not yet been precisely assessed, but preliminary estimates suggest that the expense could be disproportionate to the structure on ground, the report notes.Further, the shortcomings in the DPR that was sanctioned in 2014 are to blame for the long delay in implementing the project, the report says. After several estimates were found missing from the DPR, a revised estimate had to be prepared, taking the cost of the tower up by around ₹21 crore, an amount that will now be funded by Cochin Smart Mission Limited, Ms. Jain said. The work can resume only after the matter is presented before the council at the next meeting, she added.

Following the COVID-19 outbreak, I stocked up on sanitisers, N95 masks, and stayed at home during the lockdown. Yet, I somehow managed to contract the virus. Thanks to my paranoia, I visited the hospital the minute I developed a cough and a temperature. But not even when I was advised to take the dreaded RT-PCR test did I fear the worst; after all, I had followed all the precautions to a tee. Also read | Recovery from COVID-19 can be a struggleUnfortunately, when the results came, I suddenly found myself in a hospital bed, which was to be my home for the next 15 days. The only contact I had with the outside world was with healthcare workers in personal protective equipment who attached an IV drip to my left hand and communicated with me in sign language.I was riddled with anxiety about my family who now had to get checked. I heaved a huge sigh of relief when I received the news of their negative results a couple of days later.The symptoms of COVID-19 hit me hard. I experienced intense fatigue; it felt like a freight train had hit me. I had frequent headaches that were like “thunderclaps inside the brain”, as The New York Times aptly described them. I had lung inflammation despite not being a smoker, and a persistent cough. It is important to understand that unlike most diseases, recovering from COVID-19 is not a linear process. There were days when I woke up feeling perfectly normal, but within a few hours, I would be overcome by breathlessness and in need of an oxygen mask. I took 30 tablets a day, multiple blood tests, X-rays, CT scans, and lots of intravenous fluids. Also read | Recovered COVID-19 patients facing difficultiesHowever, it isn’t so much the physical symptoms as the the isolation which gets to you. With nobody allowed to visit and with no one to talk to (even doctors communicated only via video calls), the experience of being stuck in a room all alone was overwhelming. After two weeks, the doctors felt I was stable enough to leave (though I still hadn’t tested negative). Since then, I have been in home quarantine, picking up plates of food that my parents leave outside my bedroom door, and checking my blood oxygen levels on the pulse oximeter. A few days earlier, despite my symptoms reducing drastically, I still tested positive, which only shows that recovery can be a slow and frustrating journey. However, I have to say I am privileged and lucky: I got tested and got access to a hospital bed immediately after exhibiting symptoms, I have a comfortable room at home with family to help, and a job that allows me to work from home. Since I am a film correspondent, I get paid to review and keep track of all the movies and shows online. Watching episodes of Friends and The Office on Netflix as well as Vadivelu comedy scenes on YouTube was a great distraction for me during my time in hospital. I also recited lists of my favourite movies and football clubs every time the anxiety got too severe. Meanwhile, thousands of fellow journalists continue to brave the pandemic on a daily basis, reporting and going to office. Every case of COVID-19 is unique. I read about a teenager who tested positive four times in a row, and a 90-year-old who have fought the virus in just a week. The virus doesn’t always follow a pattern. I still don’t know how I got infected, but my only advice would be this: stay at home as much as possible.

The Madras High Court on Thursday stayed all further proceedings pursuant to fresh show cause notices issued to DMK president M.K. Stalin and 17 other MLAs of his party on September 7 for having allegedly breached the privileges of the Legislative Assembly by displaying gutkha (chewing tobacco) sachets there on July 19, 2017. Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana held that the petitioners had made out a prima facie case for grant of interim relief and the balance of convenience was also in their favour. She further ordered notice to the Speaker on the petitioners’ main plea to quash the showcause notices on grounds of perversity, illegality, mala fides and lack of jurisdiction. The judge agreed with senior counsel R. Shunmugasundaram, N.R. Elango and Amit Anand Tiwari that Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy had on August 25 given a specific finding that possession and display of gutkha sachets were neither prohibited under law nor amounted to breach of privilege.Disposing of an earlier batch of writ petitions filed by the MLAs challenging the previous show cause notices issued to them on August 28, 2017, for the same act, the first Division Bench had said that gutkha could not be equated to substances like narcotic drugs or liquor bottles, whose possession, per se, would be illegal and, therefore, might amount to breach of privilege.‘Poor enforcement’The Bench also pointed out that the intention of the MLAs in displaying the gutkha sachets in the Assembly was not to promote the substance whose manufacture, transportation, storage, distribution and sale was banned in the State. They only intended to exhibit the poor enforcement of the ban and the free availability of the substance in bunk shops. “The above judgment of the Division Bench is not challenged by the respondents [Speaker, Assembly Secretary, Committee of Privileges] herein; instead, they have thought it fit to issue fresh show cause notices based on liberty granted by the Bench to deliberate upon the issue if the committee was still of the opinion that any breach had been committed,” Justice Sathyanarayana said. In their challenge to the fresh notices through the present batch of cases, the MLAs contended that Rule 222 (1) of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Rules clearly stated that an issue of breach of privilege should be restricted to a specific matter of recent occurrence. Hence, fresh notices could not be issued in September for an event that occurred in July 2017, they argued.The petitioners also said Rule 228 prohibited a person from being a member of the Committee of Privileges if he/she had a personal or direct interest of such a character that it may prejudicially affect the proceedings. In the present case, they objected to the presence of Deputy Speaker Pollachi V. Jayaraman and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in the committee. They pointed out that the Deputy Speaker had filed a defamation suit against Mr. Stalin in the High Court, claiming compensation of over ₹1 crore, and that all DMK MLAs had been opposing the continuance of Mr. Panneerselvam in the Cabinet, despite having voted against a confidence motion moved by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on February 18, 2017. The presence of the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Chief Minister in the present committee vitiated the entire proceedings, the petitioners said.

One in every five persons in Puducherry district was infected with COVID-19 by August-end, the results of a Jipmer sero-survey have found.The findings of the sero-survey, launched in two rounds in August and September, showed that between July-end and August, the antibody sero-prevalence showed a 4.2-fold increase. This is in keeping with the 4.1-fold rise in the number of confirmed cases over the same period in Puducherry (from 2987 to 12,331), Jipmer said in a press note. The first sero-survey had indicated that one in 20 persons in the district showed evidence of COVID-19 infection.The second round data indicates that Puducherry had a high rate of transmission in August. Also, the prevalence of serological evidence with antibodies in the population is much higher than detected by RT-PCR as found at two time points; 19.6 (4.9/0.25) and 20.1 (20.7/1.03) fold respectively on July 30 and on August 30.“Thus, by the end of August, nearly one-fifth of population in Puducherry had been infected with the Covid-19 infection,” the Jipmer release said. According to the press note, two community-based serological surveys were conducted at intervals of four weeks in an attempt to find information on the extent of spread and trend of infection.Blood samples were collected from randomly selected adults from 30 clusters in a ratio of 21 urban and 9 rural areas to replicate the population distribution in Puducherry. The two surveys were conducted during August 11-16 and September 10-16.In the first round in August, 869 adults were tested and 43 (4.9%) had antibodies against SARS CoV-2 with a higher positivity in urban areas (5.7% versus 3.1%) and among women (6.3% versus 3.6%). The first round data reflects the cumulative proportion of Puducherry population infected as on July 30. In the second round, of the 898 adults tested, 186 (20.7%) had antibodies against the SARS CoV-2 infection. In the second round, the positivity rate was similar in urban and rural population (20.7% versus 20.8%) and among men and women (21.4% versus 20%). The second-round data reflects the cumulative proportion of Puducherry population which had been infected with COVID-19 as on August 30. The number of cases recorded in the district population on July 30 and August 30 respectively were 2,987 and 12,331 with incidence rates (population estimate for year 2020 is 12,00,000) of 0.25% and 1.03% respectively, the press note said.

Farmers in parts of Punjab on Thursday started a three-day ‘rail roko’ agitation under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti (KMSS) against the Union government’s three farm Bills.The railways suspended several trains completely or partially till September 26 for the safety of passengers and protection of its property. Members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) blocked railway tracks in Sangrur and Barnala, while members of the Samiti blocked railway lines in Amritsar and Ferozpur. “The ‘rail roko’ will continue till September 26 in the first phase... And if our demands are not met, we will intensify the agitation,” said Sarvan Singh Pandher, State president of KMSS. “We will also support the Bharat bandh call given by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee,” said Mr. Pandher, adding that representatives of political parties will not be allowed to share the stage in their agitation”. Terming the farm Bills an “ill-conceived move”, Mr. Pandher said their implementation would ultimately lead to exploitation of farmers at the hands of big corporates. “It will lead to the end of the Minimum Support Price regime,” he said.As many as 31 farmers’ outfits based in Punjab have given a call for a total shutdown on September 25. Over 250 farmer and farmworker organisations, under the umbrella of the AIKSCC, have given a call for ‘Bharat bandh’ the same day. Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said all the 31 farmer outfits have decided to stop railway traffic indefinitely from October 1, if their demands are not fulfilled.“Also, we will socially boycott MPs and MLAs who are in favour of the farm Bills. Besides, a resolution will be passed by the gram sabha of each village to cancel the Bills and Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh would be urged to convene a special session of the Assembly and pass a resolution not to implement agricultural laws in Punjab,” he said.The ruling Congress has extended its support to the shutdown and appealed to people to make it successful. The Shiromani Akali Dal has announced that to get the agricultural Bills reversed, the party will hold a State-wide ‘chakka-jam’ (road blockade) on September 25. The party will observe a three-hour programme from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha of the Madras High Court on Thursday recused themselves from hearing a batch of cases related to the conduct of elections to the South Indian Artistes Association (SIAA), popularly known as Nadigar Sangam. The judges directed the High Court Registry to list the case before some other Division Bench. The decision was taken after the warring groups refused to arrive at a consensus on either counting the votes of elections already held or to hold fresh elections. The administration of Nadigar Sangam had turned murky after complaints were made by some members to the Registrar of Societies in 2019 that actors Vishal, Nasser and Karthi had no right to continue as office-bearers after the completion of their three-year tenure. Immediately, the former office-bearers moved a writ petition in the High Court and obtained permission from Justice P.D. Audikesavalu to conduct the elections on June 23, 2019. However, the judge ordered that the votes should not be counted till the final disposal of the case. After taking it up for final hearing, Justice K. Kalyanasundaram set aside the election already held and ordered fresh elections. Aggrieved over such an order, the former office-bearers moved a writ appeal before the Division Bench. When the appeal, along with a few other civil suits, were listed before the Bench led by Justice Sundresh, it directed the parties to attempt a compromise whereby both could agree either for counting the votes already cast or to hold fresh elections. However, on Thursday, they reported back that no such compromise could be reached with the former office-bearers not agreeing for a fresh election and the other faction not willing to accept the counting of votes that were already cast.

Former contender for the Democratic nomination, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders jointed a host of voices that expressed alarm at U.S. President Donald Trump’s refusal to commit to the peaceful transfer of power if he loses the November election. Mr. Sanders said Mr. Trump is to be taken seriously.“What I am going to talk about is something that, in my wildest dreams, I never thought I would be discussing.  And that is the need to make certain that the President of the United States, if he loses this election, will abide by the will of the voters and leave office peacefully,” Mr. Sanders said during his speech ‘Saving American Democracy’ at George Washington University, here in Washington DC. Mr. Sanders remarks came a day after Mr. Trump, when questioned at a press briefing, would not commit to the peaceful transfer of power.“I think it is terribly important that we actually listen to, and take seriously, what Donald Trump is saying,” Mr. Sanders said.

We must ensure, in this unprecedented moment in American history that this is an election that is free and fair…” Mr. Sanders said.He called Mr. Trump a “pathological liar” with “strong authoritarian tendencies” and someone who is willing to undermine democracy to stay in power.Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated conspiracy theories around vote by mail, claiming that Democrats are using it to commit voter fraud. Mr. Sanders cited several pieces of research – including from Republican and conservative sources – to demonstrate the very low incidence of voter fraud in the U.S.Mr. Sanders listed a series of ways in which Mr. Trump, according to him, was trying to undermine the legitimacy of the elections.“Trump has also urged his supporters to become, quote, ‘poll watchers,’ but what he is really saying is he wants his supporters, some of whom are members of armed militias, to intimidate voters,” Mr. Sanders said.The senator described a hypothetical scenario in which Mr. Trump has a lead on the evening of November 3, but loses as postal ballots are counted. At which point – in Mr. Sanders’s example – Mr. Trump would say the postal ballots were invalid and claim victory.“Furthermore, in states where Republicans control the legislature, it is possible that the election results will be ignored because of false accusations of voter fraud,” Mr. Sanders said, echoing another concern of Democrats.One of the ways to counter these possibilities, Mr. Sanders said, was voter turnout (higher turnouts have traditionally benefitted Democrats).“As someone who is strongly supporting Joe Biden, let’s be clear: A landslide victory for Biden will make it virtually impossible for Trump to deny the results and is our best means for defending democracy,” he said.

Roads and Bridges Development Corporation of Kerala Limited (RBDCK) would shortly initiate proceedings against RDS Projects to recover the ₹18 crore that has been estimated to reconstruct the girders of Palarivattom flyover which developed cracks within two years of commissioning. “We may also take steps to blacklist the firm to prevent it from participating in any tenders floated by us,” a senior official of the agency said. RBDCK, a subsidiary of the Public Works Department (PWD), had received considerable flak following the flyover fiasco. “The reconstruction expense can be levied from RDS, since the cracks developed within three years (the defect liability period) of the flyover being commissioned. The cost can be recovered any time since we have not issued completion certificate for the project. Already, the government has invoked ₹4.12 crore that the firm gave as bank guarantee. The estimated reconstruction cost could have been recovered earlier but for the firm approaching the court, following which an order was issued stating that no further action could be taken against it until the case pending before the High Court was disposed off. This also hampered efforts to blacklist the firm and to realise the cost from other projects undertaken by RDS. The Supreme Court has now directed the High Court to dispose all pending appeals within six months,” he added. “There is no doubt that the cost of reconstruction must be realised from the builder firm. We would issue a notice in this regard after discussions, including with legal experts. While the government must decide on blacklisting the firm from all works in Kerala, RBDCK’s board can take a call on this with regard to our projects,” sources in the agency said. RBDCK had also kept in abeyance payment of two bills submitted by the firm, citing the damage that the new flyover sustained within two years of commissioning, it is learnt. Former Mayor Tony Chammany, who is now KPCC general secretary, demanded that the government speed up steps to recover flyover reconstruction cost from RDS Projects. “The firm may escape paying the amount if Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (DMRC) reconstructs the flyover using the money it saved while constructing overbridges in the city. The money with DMRC must be used to build an overbridge at either Vaduthala, Vathuruthy or Atlantis,” he said.

The All India Agriculture and Rural Workers Sangam has condemned the attempts being made to shift the granite seized at Somalammakonda of Cheemalapadu forest block in Ravikamatam mandal in the district.In a statement, the outfit’s national secretary P.S. Ajay Kumar said that a private company was illegally mining on the hill, located in the Kalyanalova reservoir area. The tribal people and farmers were agitating since long demanding an end to the mining in the area.The Forest and Revenue Departments conducted a survey in March this year and identified that the place where mining was being done was in a forest block. They ordered stoppage of mining and seized the mining equipment and granite on May 1, this year.He alleged that a man named V. Srinu came on behalf of the private company at around 1 a.m. on the intervening night of Wednesday/Thursday and tried to shift the granite but was prevented from doing so by tribal women who squatted on the road.The sangam demanded cancellation of ‘way bills’, issued by the Assistant Director of Mines in Anakapalle, for lifting of the granite and registration of cases against Srinu under the Forest Rights Act. He appealed to the Collector to conduct an inquiry into the incident.

Opposition strategyThough the passage of the ‘farm Bills’ in Parliament raises certain questions on the working of democratic processes, especially under the present government, the onus lies on the Opposition to make a sincere effort to inform the stakeholders — through online platforms and other forms of media — about what it perceives to be the adverse impact of the Bills in the short, medium and long term. Vague allegations about the commercialisation of agriculture, akin to what happened under British colonial policy which forced the farmer to grow indigo, will not fetch the desired results. The Opposition cannot expect an Indigo revolt in the 21st century without adequate mobilisation through sustained, systematic communication lines and the grass-root level participation of farmers and social organisations.Rohan Dixit,New DelhiCartoon in The HinduIt appears that top officials in the Food Corporation of India (FCI) have unnecessarily taken offence over the cartoon appearing in The Hindu (OpEd page, September 22), about the state of affairs in the FCI (‘Letters to the Editor’, September 24). The cartoon in question is open to multiple interpretations. To my mind, the cartoonist intended to convey a covert message through the cartoon with rats or rodents who appear to rattled by the farm Bills. The rodents represent not just the four-legged ones but presumably also the two-legged ones. While what the four-legged ones account for may be just pilferage, the loss by way of theft by the two-legged ones may run into millions of tons . The FCI may be well equipped to minimise the losses, but the same thing cannot be said about the two-legged ones as there may be a network actively involved in rackets whose ingenuity to outsmart any surveillance and detection is just fantastic. Moreover, in the backdrop, one sees an FCI signboard which has been scored out and written with a line that says ‘Private Warehouse’. One has to take into account the totality of the elements of a cartoon to make sense of it. Contrary to what the FCI letter claims about the high standards of storage and maintenance of FCI warehouses, reports of damage to foodgrains, pilferage and even thefts are not uncommon. A long time, a leading news daily even published a shocking story of what it called the ‘great grain robbery’, forcing the government on the backfoot. I do not claim to have decoded the cartoon in question but all I am suggesting is that the cartoon is not just about four-legged rodents. However, only the cartoonist should be able to clarify it. Perhaps the Readers’ Editor, The Hindu should ask the cartoonist to step in when there is a sharp criticism of his work.M.

The mystic, celestial snow lion, ‘Gang Seng Ge’ in local lore, derives its name from the Sanskrit Simha. It is the emblem of Tibet showcasing its eternally snow-covered mountains and glaciers, even as it symbolises power, strength, fearlessness and the joy of living. It is also the symbol and the flag of the intrepid, fearless warriors of the ‘Special Frontier Force’, or the SFF, which has figured so prominently in the recent clashes in eastern Ladakh.Standoff in the heightsTowards the end of April this year, 4 Motorised and 6 Mechanised Divisions of the Chinese Western Theatre Command, having completed their exercises on the edge of the Gobi Desert, took to the Xinjiang highway. In a well-planned and rehearsed move, they branched off onto a series of feeder roads on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. Once the troops were in position, they initiated multiple incursions across the LAC into what had been “No Man’s Land” patrolled by both sides (India and China). This included areas in the Depsang plains threatening the forward airstrip of Daulat Beg Oldie as also the north and the south of the expansive Pangong Tso salt water lake.Special Frontier Force | They came, they fought, they stayedThe world watched in horror, as soldiers of two nuclear armed Asian giants engaged each other in a slug fest on the snowy summits of the Himalayas. In the melee that followed, they went at each other with clubs studded with barbed wire, machetes and rocks, resulting in serious injuries. Not a shot was fired, but the Indian Army which was initially surprised, reacted swiftly and with bravery and courage inflicted casualties to the Chinese side.The inevitable fallout of these actions was both sides jostling for heights, leading to a stalemate. Suddenly, on the night of August 29-30, in a surprise move, the Indian Army turned the tables on China by occupying heights that were not only of great tactical importance north and south of the Pangong Tso lake as also dominating the Spangur Gap. It was now looking into the innards of the Chinese depth localities at Moldo including China’s armour, guns and reserves. This amazing feat was accomplished primarily by a Ghost Army, the Special Frontier Force. Who are these super human troops? What are their antecedents? They are the dreaded shadow warriors of the SFF.Working in the shadowsDuring the era of the “Great Game”, the British employed natives to patrol their own lands, which included Tibetans. It was the Mustang Base in the Northern Border Range that escorted the 14th Dalai Lama to safety to India during the 1959 rebellion. As a consequence of the 1962 war, the Jawaharlal Nehru government ordered the raising of an elite Commando Force called the Special Frontier Force comprising among others, Tibetans who had sought refuge in India along with the Dalai Lama.Also read | With public funeral for Tibetan soldier, Delhi sends a signal to BeijingMy father, Major General Sujan Singh Uban, was a natural choice for this based on sheer merit and his being a legendary war veteran of the British Army famous for his daring exploits with the Long Range Desert Group in the Middle East, and the Guerrilla Wars in Burma during World War II. He was tasked with raising, training and commanding this nascent Force; as also moulding them into a well-oiled fighting machine.To enhance their inherent fighting capabilities its members were given airborne training in addition to acquiring expertise in mountain and jungle warfare. Initially aided and equipped by the United States, they quickly indigenised and were soon on their own feet. The opportunity to display their mettle as also to repay their host country came during the India-Pakistan war of 1971. As the Indian Army moved in with its major thrust into East Pakistan, the SFF, while supporting the flank of the Indian Army, in a blitzkrieg cleared the Chittagong hill tracts, as also the Kaptai dam, and encircled and prevented the escape of the Pakistani 97 (Indep) Brigade and No 2 Commando Battalion, all of whom were taken prisoners. The SFF was poised for the capture of Chittagong port when a ceasefire was declared; a daring move which paid handsome dividends. This earned them the nom de guerre, the ‘Phantoms of Chittagong’.Also read | India's secret war in BangladeshThe importance of TibetIt soon became my turn to serve the SFF, enabling me to fulfil a family commitment. Having performed exceedingly well in the Indian Army (including being awarded the Vishisht Seva Medal (VSM) and based on my record of service) I was promoted as Inspector General to command the SFF and was privileged to command it during the Kargil war in battles fought at heights of 14,000 feet and above in subzero temperatures; actions which were lauded in the Ladakh and Kargil sectors. That year, the security for the Amarnath Yatra was provided by the SFF.The strategic importance of Tibet cannot be overemphasised. It is the roof of the world, with vast mineral and natural resources. The mighty rivers that emanate from its expansive glaciers — such as the Brahmaputra, the Yangtse, the Yellow river, the Mekong, the Salween and the Indus — together with thousands of their tributaries have nurtured civilisations in peripheral countries for centuries. The Kailash Mansarovar, which is centered in this region and with its spiritual overtones, tugs at the heart strings of every Indian. In an act of naked aggression, China occupied Tibet in 1959.A buffer was eliminated, and the de facto boundary of China became contiguous to that of India, a boundary deliberately left undemarcated to enable further expansion. Mao Zedong declared, “Tibet is the palm that we shall occupy and then go after the five fingers, Ladakh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.” Consequently, in 1959, China committed the naked act of aggression, to which India acquiesced, and our dream of “Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai” was rudely shaken in 1962.Comment | A phantom called the Line of Actual ControlUnderstanding China’s standIndia is dealing with a bellicose neighbour, with its obsession for asserting its rights over land which its predecessors may have acquired through conquest or guile. China has land borders with 14 neighbours covering an estimated 22,100 kilometres. Post independence, and as its economic status burgeoned, so did its military muscle. China embarked on claims based on perceived imbalances of treaties forced on countries when they were weak.Some of these have since been resolved after bloody clashes such as with Russia and Vietnam, while others have been resolved using a combination of lucrative offers of money, trade and guile. In most cases, the end result has been such that victory can be claimed by both sides.Russia accepted half of China’s claim, Kazakhstan was given lucrative economic deals, Kyrgyzstan retained 70% of the land, ceding just 30%, and so on.The Hindu Explains | What are the agreements that govern India and China’s actions?It would be fallacious to surmise that there will be any resolution to the on-going stand-off between India and China in the near future. Let us assume that both countries wish to avoid a full-scale war considering the nuclear backdrop, the COVID-19 pandemic and also the economic downturn. The road ahead will have to be evolved and based on a study of the manner in which China has negotiated its boundary disputes with 12 of its neighbours and the results achieved.What must be doneThere can be little doubt that the actions by the People’s Liberation Army, or the PLA, in Ladakh were pre-meditated, planned and executed with precision. The Chinese were fully aware that they were transgressing into “No Man’s Land”. With a pre-determined aim in mind they proceeded to secure tactical heights and gained access to the areas which would forestall a counter-offensive by the Indian Army. To expect them to vacate these areas at this juncture would be naive. At the same time, the PLA, in its present configuration and posture, has immense weaknesses which they would be aware of, and which should make them uneasy.Under the prevailing circumstances, it has become imperative to form a group of experts from among retired professionals, who have a proven track record with the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the Indian Air Force, diplomats, the intelligence services, cyber technology and cartographic services, who will plan and prepare, short-, medium- and long-term goals to achieve them within a suggested time frame. Let us play down the rhetoric and adopt a pragmatic approach. It can no longer be a part-time issue to be addressed only when a crisis occurs. The crisis is upon us now.Gurdip Singh Uban is former Inspector General, Special Frontier Force

Health facilities are a place of healing and restoration. But can they be places of harm as well? The world over, one in 10 patients experiences or is subject to harm in health-care settings. These range from operations done on the wrong patient, to injections being administered in an unsafe manner. Studies in India have shown that more than two-thirds of injections are given in an unsafe manner; equally worrying is the fact that over two-thirds of injections in primary care are unnecessary in the first place.Global focusTo highlight this important issue, the World Health Organization observes World Patient Safety Day every year (September 17). The theme for 2020 was ‘Health Worker Safety: A Priority for Patient Safety’ with a call to action to ‘Speak up for health worker safety!’ But one may wonder, why, on a day dedicated for patient safety, we should speak up for health worker safety? So, why is health worker safety important for patient safety?Editorial | Protection for protectors: On safety of healthcare workersMuch harm done to patients in health-care settings is because of unsafe health-care practice and unsafe health-care communication. Unsafe health-care practice refers to unsafe or unnecessary procedures, wrong medications, medications given in a wrong dosage, etc. Unsafe health-care communication refers to mistakes made in health-care settings due to miscommunication between health professionals, for example, during patient handover in between staff shifts. The quality of both practice and communication is dependent on the safety and well-being of health workers. For example, numerous studies have shown that health workers, such as residents, who have been on duty for more than 24 hours at a stretch, have a higher risk of making mistakes, increasing the likelihood of a direct impact on patient safety.COVID-19 and reporting casesDuring the current COVID-19 crisis, health workers are not only putting in longer hours but also working under increasingly difficult circumstances, which affect both their physical and mental health. The mental health of health workers is linked to the workplace culture. Some organisations have a culture of supporting staff, responding to their needs and encouraging learning from mistakes; while others have a culture of fault-finding, blame, guilt and abuse. When instances of patient harm occur, whether people feel encouraged to report them, depends on the organisation’s culture and leadership. Without reporting, it is difficult for organisations to learn from mistakes and create systems, such as check lists in order to prevent similar future occurrences. In addition, in India, it is not uncommon to find health-care organisations observe strict hierarchies between specialties, between designations, and between doctors and other health professionals, such as nurses. Such power differences can further prevent reporting and cooperative organisational learning and may, in fact, increase chances of abuse: verbal, physical, emotional and sexual, putting the safety of health workers and patients at risk.Also read | In Chennai, doctor’s burial marred by protests, attacksLooking at the organisationOrganisational learning is more important than individual learning. This is because instances of patient harm, even when they occur at the individual level, are often an end result of a chain of organisational failures. For example, systemic under staffing, lack of reporting mechanisms, lack of dedicated time for hand overs, audits, training and team building, poorly maintained equipment and corruption in purchases, are all organisational failures that could result in a cascade leading to avoidable harm to the patient. Moreover, good systems can mitigate the effects of individual mistakes.Thus, it is pertinent to look beyond the individual to look at the organisation as the sum of multiple elements that interact with each other. This involves taking a systems approach. What does that involve? Let us take the example of overcrowding. In many hospitals, quality of care is often compromised because of overcrowding, such as in the emergency department. To take a systems approach in this situation would mean looking at it holistically — for example, from at least three angles using the input-throughput-output conceptual model described by Asplin et al in the Annals of Emergency Medicine in 2003. Editorial | Do no harm: on safety of health care workersOne, the input: looking at whether patients who come to the emergency department need to be there in the first place or could be managed somewhere else such as in the community itself. Two, the throughput: looking at whether there are inefficiencies such as shortage of doctors, nurses, equipment or space that is increasing the time taken for patients to be treated. And three, the output: looking at whether the patients are staying longer in the emergency department than required because of lack of non-emergency department inpatient beds, delays at the pharmacy or delays in transportation of patients out of the emergency department. The conversation on health during COVID-19 has often centred on individuals, with certain individuals, such as health-care workers, seen as heroes, and others (including those referred to as ‘super spreaders’ in a stigmatising way), seen as villains. Many health workers have demonstrated excellence despite the limitations in the Indian health system. This is laudable but may not be sustainable. Creating sustainability would involve taking a systems approach to make sure all parts of the system, both of health care and of supportive social care are well functioning.Also read | Why health care workers above 60 should be ‘benched’Many health workers are overworked not by choice, but rather the lack of it since understaffing and shortages are a common feature of the Indian public health-care system. In addition, India simply does not have enough health facilities to cater to all its population, even without a pandemic. Further, the lack of adequate social care, such as care homes, community health services and community-based rehabilitative and palliative services, unduly increase the burden on health-care facilities.Stakeholder involvementFinally, a systems approach involves all stakeholders. Patients themselves need to be aware of patient safety as well as be empowered to demand safe health care and resist unnecessary medications and procedures. Hospital managers must understand the need for and be empowered to create systems of reporting, monitoring and organisational learning. Policy makers must prioritise staffing, co-designing functional and safe workplaces, and ethics in health care.Also read | ASHA workers soldier on — unprotected and poorly paidNumerous persons find healing and restoration in health care. But some are harmed as well. In crises such as COVID-19, quality of care can be compromised further. We can help improve patient safety by taking a systems approach and promoting a culture of health worker safety and well-being.Dr. Harikeerthan Raghuram is a public health researcher and consultant.
