With most of the public being dependent on their own vehicles due to fear of possible spread of the COVID-19 and many activities yet to resume, taxi drivers, auto-rickshaw drivers in the city are facing bad days, as very few are opting for their service. The drivers say that they are yet to recover from the financial hurdles caused by the lockdown.“On Tuesday, I was at work from 6.30 a.m. to 9 a.m. I had only one passenger and earned just ₹134. Earlier a cab driver used to earn a minimum ₹1,500 per day if he worked from 9 a.m to 9 p.m., but now, earning ₹500 is like a dream come true,” said S. Murali, who works for a ride sharing company.Mr. Murali said that the car is being sanitised neatly and he has been taking all precautions. “Public are using their own vehicles or they are asking their friends, relatives in case of any need for transportation. Many fear that they might be infected. It would take time for us to gain public trust that we are following safety protocol without fail,” he said. Similarly, J. Raju, an auto-rickshaw driver from Arilova, said that he is allowing not more than three passengers in his vehicle. Besides, he has arranged a transparent plastic sheet in between driver cabin and passengers. However, he is not having enough number of passengers. According to the drivers, lack of tourists, adequate trains, buses, cinemas, multiplexes, educational institutions and a few others is having an impact on their income.“Our main passengers are students, people going to theatres and then travellers. They count more than half of our passengers. This is where we are being hit. The money earned these days is not at all sufficient to run my family. House rents, vehicle EMIs, fuel bills, daily essentials, cannot be managed with this income,” said Lovaraju, another auto-rickshaw driver from Hanumanthuwaka. Cab drivers also say that people going to cinemas and shopping are their majority of customers. They are hopeful of a good tourist season for their revival.30% occupancyNot just the auto-rickshaws or cabs, even APSRTC is facing the same problem.Resuming services after nearly six months, in the first three days after hitting the roads, the city buses service saw just 30% occupancy.According to Regional Manager, APSRTC, Visakhapatnam, M.Y. Danam, on the first day the occupancy was just 25 % and in the next two days, it is around 30%. On the first day, we have run 100 buses (both ordinary and metro services) only and from Sunday, keeping in view of various examinations, we have increased to 200 on various routes, he said.“Due to the COVID-19 situation, the occupancy is less as of now. We hope gradually it will increase. Moreover, we have been sanitising the buses frequently and not allowing passengers without masks,” he said.

Submit reportSources privy to information in this regard said the experts had been asked to submit their report by the end of the month, following which it would be discussed at a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in attendance, to effectively attempt at reducing cases in containment zones to non-existent levels. According to official figures, there are 2,059 containment zones across Delhi as of September 23 up from 1,751 on September 17 — an increase of 308 over the last week or 51 being delineated per day. Government records posit that active containment zones are up to 1,612 from 1,433 and the number of zones removed from the list of containment zones has increased to 1,464 from 1,293.

Mr. Baijal, at a meeting of the DDMA on September 18, according to sources, had observed that the administration’s focused attention should be on containing transmission as well as improving the recovery of patients and reducing deaths due to COVID-19. Mr. Baijal had also directed expert groups to prepare a blueprint on restrategising the containment policy.

Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Thursday said the Centre’s agriculture sector Bills were primarily aimed at lifting the safety cover in the form of Minimum Support Price (MSP), thereby ruining the food growers of the country.Mr. Badal said Punjabis would not accept any such move that aimed to harm farmers’ interests, and the State government would vehemently oppose these attempts of the BJP-led Union government. “No one will be allowed to harm the interests of farmers at any cost. The agriculture Bills will deprive the farmers of a safety cover in the form of MSP,” said Mr. Badal.He said the ₹50 increase in MSP of wheat announced by the Centre recently was the least in the previous decade (only 2.6%). He said this was despite the fact that the Commission for Agriculture Cost and Prices (CACP) had recommended an MSP increase of 6% in the wake of 8.4% food inflation. “This is a pointer that the Union government is dragging its feet from giving due MSP to farmers,” said Mr. Badal.Highlighting the significance of MSP to farmers, the Finance Minister said that besides ensuring well being of food growers, it also acted as a catalyst in the State’s development. In Punjab, procurement of food grains worth ₹70,000 crore took place every year. Mr. Badal said the State received ₹3,900 crore mandi fees annually, which was used for maintenance, repair, and upkeep of 65,000 km of link roads, bridges, culverts, mandis, and other infrastructure.‘BJP anti-Punjab ’The Finance Minister said Punjab always borne the brunt of the BJP government’s anti-Punjab stance. “Special tax concessions to hill States, the GST regime, and now these agriculture Bills have broken the backbone of Punjab’s economy,” said Mr. Badal. The worst part was that the Shiromani Akali Dal had always been part and parcel of the BJP’s anti-Punjab tirade, he said.

Shortly after taking over the probe into two cases related to the violence at D.J. Halli and K.G. Halli, where the city police invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday conducted searches at 30 locations in Bengaluru and arrested a “key conspirator”.

After 15 days of protest at the nearby hills, tribal youth on Thursday laid siege to the Udaipur-Ahmedabad national highway in Rajasthan’s Dungarpur district with the demand for recruitment to vacant posts of teachers in the Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) area. The protesters clashed with the policemen, who lobbed teargas shells to disperse them.Several tribal youth and policemen were injured in the scuffle, but the highway remained blocked till late in the evening. Though the traffic was diverted to other routes, a massive jam for several kilometres was witnessed on the highway.Policemen injuredThe youth hurled stones and damaged a large number of vehicles after blocking the road. Police used force to bring the situation under control, but Additional Superintendent of Police Ganpati Mahawar and several other policemen, brought mainly from Bichhiwara police station, were injured in the clash.The youth have been demanding the appointment of Scheduled Tribe candidates to 1,167 posts of general category teachers for TSP area, left vacant after the Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers (REET) held in 2018. They were earlier staging a protest on the issue at Kakri-Dungri hills, situated adjacent to the national highway.The Bichhiwara police had registered two cases on the protest, terming it as violative of the guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic. The district officials had tried to persuade the agitating youth to stage their protest at a designated place after getting the Collector’s permission, but the demonstrators did not relent.The TSP area in Rajasthan comprises the complete Banswara, Dungarpur and Pratapgarh districts and some blocks in five other districts. With the delay in the holding of this year's REET, which has been postponed several times, the tribal candidates lost patience and raised the demand for recruitment to the posts which remained unfilled in 2018.

October 20 would be the deadline for procurement of CMR for yasangi season, he said. The Chief Secretary held tele-conference with district Collectors on CMR procurement on Thursday.He said the delay in procurement of CMR is imposing additional financial burden on the State. The district Collectors should, therefore, expedite procurement to avoid scope for such things, he said.The district administration should be geared up to commence procurement of food grain for the Vaanakalam season 2020-21 from farmers, he said.Steps should be taken to make arrangements at procurement centres to enable farmers to sell their produce at minimum support price, he said.Mr. Somesh Kumar later interacted with officials of the Civil Supplies Department and Food Corporation of India on the problems faced while procuring CMR.

Ever since the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014, the Centre slowly but steadily has been snatching the rights of States, said Legislative Council Chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy on Thursday. “This will have severe consequences in future,” he said. Condemning the farm bills passed by the Parliament – The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, The Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, he said: they are only for the benefit of the corporates. Addressing press persons at his residence in the town, Mr. Reddy said the bills would soon eliminate the agriculture produce market committee system, the Food Corporation of India, and eventually become the bane of life for the 86% small and marginal farmers in the country. He described the legislation as unjust. They cannot be labelled as reforms, he said. Similar encroachments, as Mr. Reddy put it, are the Electricity Bill and the New Education Policy which are State subjects, but with the Centre’s intervention, the 24-hour free electricity for farmers in Telangana, the imposition of Hindi in Tamil Nadu, and the like, will have severe consequences. According to him, such legislation is “an outcome of unilateral decision-making by the Centre,” and the only workable way is dialogue and deliberation with all the stakeholders, he said.

With the cotton season round the corner, small and medium ginning and pressing enterprisers in Adilabad town hope to get sufficient orders from the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) to process cotton ‘kapas’ into bales. There are 28 ginning mills, including 14 small units, operating in this industry. The CCI procures cotton kapas directly from the producers and sends it to the millers to separate cotton fibre from the seed bolls and dust particles. The cotton lint is further compressed into bales. Poor orders last year“Last year, we did not get sufficient orders for processing, and mostly remained idle. We fervently hope that the CCI would equitably distribute job orders among all the existing units,” a ginning mill owner said. He alleged that last year more than four lakh bales were processed in the town alone of which over a lakh bales were processed in four or five units.“The small units got cotton too short of their processing capacity,” he alleged. However, CCI General Manager of Adilabad district, Sanjay Kumar, said that based on their requirement, the process orders would be placed in the coming season as well. “We do not discriminate between small and big millers. But, based on our delivery schedule we assign work,” he said. “This year due to late rainfalls, the season is expected to start a few days before or after Dasara, for which we are preparing at a brisk pace. We have already identified warehouses for storing the bales,” Mr. Kumar said.

 Domestic workers staged a dharna in front of the AG’s Office here on Thursday demanding a comprehensive law for better working conditions, compensation to domestic workers who have lost jobs, and implementation of the urban employment scheme. The protest organised under the umbrella of the SEWA-Union was part of a national agitation against the changes brought by the Union government to labour laws. Inaugurating the protest, Sonia George, general secretary of the SEWA-Union, said the dharna was the first of protests by domestic workers. In a statement here, the SEWA-Union said domestic workers were among the section of workers who had lost their jobs the most. Though they provided an essential service, they were being kept away from the workplace on the grounds of being virus carriers. The labour bills passed by Parliament did not cover domestic workers. Ms. George said the Code on Social Security did not define private homes as an establishment or define an employer. Till then, workspaces of domestic workers would not get any recognition and they would not be able to highlight any violation of labour rights in that space. There were apprehensions that the domestic workers would not get any entitlements if they could not prove they were a worker, though the Union government’s argument was that they were universalising social security benefits, she said.

Sabbani Janakiramulu, an oustee of Mamidyala village in Mulugu mandal attempted suicide by dousing himself with kerosene before the Revenue Divisional Office (RDO) at Gajwel on Thursday. Mr. Janakiramulu alleged that for the past few years he has been denied Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) benefits and repeated appeals to officials failed to yield results. Mr. Janakiramulu came to RDO office with kerosene bottle. However, those present at the spot threw away the kerosene bottle and informed the police. Police immediately shifted him to a station, where they registered a case and are investigating.According to sources, S. Narasmihulu, S. Janakiramulu and Harikrishna are brothers and had a house spread on 350 yards and three acres of land. The land and house were acquired by the government for Kodapochammasagar reservoir and they were given compensation. However, they were not offered R&R package. “We gave away our land and house for the construction of Kondapochamma reservoir. In the first list, houses were allotted to about 400 plus oustees of the village. In the second list, names of as many as 181 persons were identified but allotment was made to only 137 persons, while the remaining are still waiting. Our names are in second list which means we are eligible for houses. But, despite moving around Revenue offices, we are not being allotted houses and officials are not responding properly. Myself and my brother Harikirshna have migrated to Kukatpally about a decade back to make a living. But those who migrated well before us from the village got the R&R package and why cannot we is our question,” Mr. Janakiramulu told The Hindu.“Janakiramulu is not eligible for R&R package as he is not staying in the village for the past one-and-a-half decade. The other compensations were already paid to him. A case was registered against him for creating nuisance at Gajwel police station,” said RDO D. Vijayender Reddy.

The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a case against a senior bank official and two others, including a functionary of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, in connection with the seizure of ₹11.48 crore by the Income Tax Department in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election in Vellore. Searches were conducted on the premises of the trio and investigators seized certain documents relating to the case, sources in the agency said on Thursday. A couple of days ago, the CBI’s Anti-Corruption Branch registered a case against Dayanidhi, the then senior manager, Canara Bank, Vellore, DMK functionary ‘Poonjolai’ Srinivasan, his brother Damodaran and others in connection with the seizure of several wads of newly- printed currency of ₹200 denomination. The case was registered under Section 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 477(A) (falsification of accounts) and other provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The agency said reliable information had been received that the Income Tax Department conducted searches on the premises of Mr. Damodaran in Vellore on April 1, 2019, and seized ₹11.48 crore. During the course of investigation, Mr. Srinivasan claimed that the money belonged to him and was meant for distribution to voters in the Vellore Parliamentary constituency ahead of the election. Based on the seizure, the election was cancelled in the Vellore Lok Sabha constituency and a case was registered against D. Kathir Anand (the candidate and son of senior DMK leader Duraimurugan) under the provisions of the IPC and the Representation of the People Act, 1951, relating to distribution of cash to voters. The CBI said in the First Information Report that the cash in ₹200 denomination was obtained from the currency chest of Canara Bank, Vellore, by exchanging notes of other denominations. Mr. Dayanidhi had allegedly colluded with the accused persons by abusing his official position and hence committed the offence of criminal misconduct. “The currency was obtained for facilitating easy distribution of currency notes to the voters in the Vellore Parliamentary constituency during the Parliament election which was to be held on 18.04.2019,” the agency said and added that the activity promoted corruption. In a formal note to the CBI, the bank authorities confirmed that the senior manager had exchanged the currency notes in the chest without following due procedures. The searches come a couple of days after Mr. Anand, who later contested and won the election, complained that two persons posing as police officials barged into his room at Tamil Nadu House, New Delhi, and questioned him on the issues that the party was planning to raise in Parliament. Parrying questions on the nature of seizures made on the premises of the trio on Thursday, a CBI official said the agency would summon them soon for questioning. The investigator refused to comment on the role of the MP in the case and also whether he would be questioned.

A 22-year-old youngster from Gundala village in Ranga Reddy district, on Thursday admitted to killing his father 50-days ago and later buried his body in their agriculture field. His mother Lalitha allegedly helped him. Shamshabad Deputy Commissioner of Police N Prakash Reddy said that the offence took place on the night of July 30 over petty disputes. The accused, Rakesh, told police that his father S. Kistaiah alias Krishna, a farmer, was physically abusing Lalitha, and him after consuming liquor. On the fateful night too, Kistaiah picked up a heated argument with them, following which the mother-son duo throttled him to death, police said. “While Rakesh was throttling, Lalitha held Kistaiah's legs. After 10 p.m., they took the body to their field on a bike, about two kilometres from the house, where they dug a pit and buried it,” Mr. Reddy said. When relatives and family members enquired about the victim's sudden disappearance, the accused told them that Kistaiah was working in Hyderabad as a daily wager owing to financial problems. ""Even after 50-day when he did not return, their relatives grew suspicious and confronted Rakesh, who later confessed of killing his father with the help of his mother,"" the DCP said. He said that a case was registered and the victim's body will be exhumed on Friday morning. Later, the remnants of the body will be sent to the government hospital for autopsy.

TDP Polit Bureau member and Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu has demanded that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy spell out the outcome of his visit to Delhi. “Mr. Jagan has made many visits to Delhi since he assumed office, and it is his bounden duty to tell people about the new projects he brought for the State,” Mr. Ramakrishnudu said in a statement on Thursday.Mr. Ramakrishnudu sought to know why the Chief Minister was maintaining silence on all major issues, including his visits to Delhi. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s meetings with the Union Ministers were solely aimed at saving his skin and coming clean out of the cases filed against him. All his visits to Delhi and deeds were at the cost of larger interests of the people, he said, adding, “It has become a routine for the CM to commit atrocities in the State and go to Delhi to get reprimanded for his omissions.”Accusing the YSRCP of perpetrating a “loot and hoard” regime on the people of the State, Mr. Ramakrishnudu deplored that the Chief Minister had not been acting in a desired fashion with regard to promises made in the Reorganisation Act. Though the Amaravati capital issue was pending before the court, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and his MPs were repeatedly raising the issue with the Central government, he said.Mr. Ramakrishnudu expressed surprise that the State government had stopped all development works and projects, but was asking the Centre for funds. “Mr. Jagan has no minimum understanding that Central funds will be released only if the government shows some progress on the projects. There will be no support if the State goes on misusing the funds in every way possible,” he said.

A person accused of child sexual abuse escaped recently from the first-line treatment centre (FLTC) being run at the convention centre of the Kochi airport, throwing light on the challenge being faced by the police in guarding those who have tested positive for SARS-COV-2.The infected among those arrested by the police and excise are put up at the FLTC at Kochi airport along with other infected members of the public. Though police personnel are put on guard duty at the centre, the security remains far from foolproof. “We have taken up the matter with the District Disaster Management Authority, that it is really tough to keep a tab on the accused who mix with the civilians. A possible solution is a separate FLTC exclusively for the arrested. With those arrested increasingly testing positive since September, the task is getting progressively difficult,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief. While the centre has multiple entries and exit points, police are deployed only at the main entrance, which is more than 100 metres away from the facility. “The accused are not always in the sight of the police guards who have to largely depend on information from health and paramedical staff at the centre. We have already petitioned the District Police Chief and now plan to raise it with the District Collector as well,” said M.V. Sanil, district secretary (Ernakulam Rural) of Kerala Police Association.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asked public representatives and officials to work round-the-clock for the strict implementation of the recent legislations enacted by the State government as they were people-centric and aimed at their welfare. At a meeting with public representatives of municipalities and Mayors of various other municipal corporations, Mr. Rao said the objective of the legislations is to see that the poor do not suffer in the deliverables of the government. The fruits of the legislations should go up to the last mile, he said.He asked the participants at the meeting to involve themselves at the grassroots level in the online registration of non-agriculture properties like plots, flats and houses. As part of revolutionary administrative reforms in the State, the government had enacted several legislations for effective use of people for decades. However, the poor should not be adversely affected in the implementation of the Acts, he said. Mr. Rao said the government has no intention of filling its purse with money collected from poor through regularisation of lands. He asked officials to prepare solutions for problems faced by people in regard to lands and properties before the Dharani portal becomes fully operational. The government would solve all problems linked to residential premises and construction sites which piled up for several decades, Mr. Rao said. ApprehensionsIn the initial days of formation of Telangana, people expressed severe apprehensions that land rates will drop.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is looking to install solar lights along its roads in the State. On a trial basis, the project will be carried out on the Krishnagiri-Walajapet National Highway.""Going solar will help the environment as it is clean energy. It would also cut down the heavy power bills of toll operators. Also, since it is to be connected to the grid, they will get some relief on the investment. Some contractors pay power bills of up to ₹20 lakh a month for road lighting, which could be brought down,” explained a senior official of the NHAI.As a first step, the toll plazas will get solar lighting. “We have to study the system and see how it functions for a couple of months before we extend solar power to other places along the highway. The concessionaire has already provided lighting at places where there are human habitations,” said another official.However, the only hitch in the proposal is the low rate of ₹2 per unit being offered by Tangedco. “Now, commercial connections are charged ₹9 per unit. We are proposing to supply power to the grid. In such a case, a better rate is only fair. The State government should consider our request,” he said. Tangedco sources said they were only collecting the rates on the basis of what had been stipulated by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Authority. “It is not our decision,"" the official said.

The Opposition is politicising the visit of Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy to Tirumala and has stooped to a new low by playing the religious card for its selfish goals, says Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, Adviser (Public Affairs).Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said the opposition parties were trying to defame the government by creating unnecessary disputes. ‘CM followed traditions’“The Chief Minister went to Tirumala and took part in all the rituals duly following the traditions. He offered ‘silk vastrams’ to the Lord and a look at his countenance indicated that he was full of religious fervour. But it is ironic that the TDP leaders, with the support of the media favourable to them, are creating a ruckus and misleading the people,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said.Stating that an administrator would not be confined to a particular caste or religion, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was a people’s leader.While alleging that the recent spate of attacks on temples could have been orchestrated by some evil forces, he said that the needle of suspicion pointed to the TDP leaders.He stated that the TDP leaders were creating controversies not with faith in Hinduism but with the grievance that they were not in power. He asserted that TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu was a litigant, who always strived for public attention, and thus politicised “minor issues” to get political mileage.“Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy is implementing welfare schemes to benefit the downtrodden and weaker sections of society by fulfilling each of every promise made,” he said.

The police on Thursday foiled the attempts made by the BJP cadres to lay a siege to the Sub-Collector’s office here in protest against the derogatory comments allegedly made by Minister for Civil Supplies Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. No sooner than the party activists set out from their city office at Suryaraopet did the police swoop on them to prevent any untoward incident. But BJP State vice-president S. Vishnuvardhan Reddy, treasurer Vamaraju Satya Murthy, and leaders such as Pathuri Nagabhushanam, A. Sriram, Vangaveeti Narendra, and N. Bala managed to wriggle out and reach the Sub-Collector’s office, only to be picked up from there.Mr. Venkateswara Rao’s remarks evoked angry outbursts from the BJP leaders, who insisted that the Minister be dismissed from the Cabinet for commenting on the personal matters of Mr. Modi and Mr. Adityanath. Dig at CMMr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said the silence of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy proved that Mr. Venkateswara Rao, MLA R.K. Roja and other YSRCP leaders were acting at his behest.He alleged that innocent Hindus, who were agitating against the burning down of the chariot of the Antarvedi temple, were falsely implicated in cases. On the other hand, attacks on temples and desecration of idols continued as the Chief Minister turned a blind eye to the incidents. The BJP would not keep quite if forces inimical to Hinduism tried to further malign the Gods and Goddesses and destroy temples and capture their properties, Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy warned.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday announced that clubs organising Durga Puja in the State would get financial assistance of ₹50,000 each.“I know that Puja committees are in trouble this year. We offer a small help to them … Since the problems this year have increased, we have decided to give ₹50,000 to each club,” Ms. Banerjee said at an event at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. The announcement was applauded by representatives of clubs at the venue.There are nearly 37,000 community Durga Pujas organised by local clubs and the financial aid, up from last year’s ₹25,000, will cost the ex-chequer ₹185 crore. Besides the ₹50,000 as assistance, the Chief Minister announced that the Fire Department and civic bodies would not charge any fee from Puja organisers. In addition, the Calcutta Electric Power Distribution Company ( CESC) and West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited will offer a rebate of 50% on the power consumed by the clubs during the festival.Thursday’s announcement drew criticism from the Opposition parties. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) State unit secretary Surjya Kant Mishra said at a time when the State government was unable to give even the promised rations or provide proper medical support for COVID-19 patients, this kind of expenditure was unthinkable.Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP) State vice president Ritesh Tewari said this again indicated that Trinamool Congress “defeat in the Assembly elections is a certainty”.Last year, Ms. Banerjee had increased the financial assistance from ₹10,000 to ₹25,000 which had drawn much criticism.

Seven Indian Police Service officers from various States undergoing Mid-Career Training Programme (MCTP) Phase-III at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy (SVPNPA) tested positive for coronavirus. As they were asymptomatic, the administration isolated them in special facilities on the campus. The primary contact of the victims were also identified and they too were isolated. Confirming this to The Hindu, NPA Director Atul Karwal said 79 IPS officials from across the country, with seven to nine years of service, came to their alma mater in the second week of September, to prepare themselves for the next level of competency and honing up skills with a global perspective.“They were quarantined for 10 days after coming to the campus from their cadre. However, online training started on September 14, as per schedule, which they were attending from their accommodations,” he said. Last weekend, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody tests were conducted on the quarantined officials, and results were out on Tuesday. Of them, seven tested positive. “Today, we have started regular training for those who tested negative. Classes are being conducted outdoors as a precautionary measure,” the official said. “We are facing the pandemic and police officers are the frontline force. All of them have worked as COVID warriors in their States, and for them the chance of infection was obviously high,” Mr. Karwal said, adding that some might have contracted the virus during their journey to Hyderabad.

 The repeated COVID-19 episodes reported in a man from Thrissur is posing a diagnostic challenge for health officials. Savio Joseph, 38, from Ponnukkara, who was working in Muscat, has contracted the infection thrice. Though he does not have documents to prove the first bout while in Muscat, the second and third episodes happened in Thrissur. “I showed symptoms in Muscat during the end of February. I contracted an infection from a friend, who had travel history to China. He was given treatment for pneumonia. After three weeks, I too developed similar symptoms. I had fever, cough, throat and chest pain, and breathlessness. However, the hospital did not identify it as COVID-19,” says Savio. Soon, the majority of workers in Savio’s company contracted the pandemic, five deaths were also reported. Savio returned to Kerala on June 28. While in quarantine, he appeared for COVID-19 test on July 18, which turned positive. He was discharged from Thrissur Medical College Hospital on August 1 after he tested negative in an antigen test. But when difficulty in breathing and chest pain persisted, he appeared for a test again on September 1, which turned positive. Discharged from hospital once again, Savio as well as health officials are clueless whether it is a case of relapse or prolonged viral shedding. Viral shedding occurs when a virus replicates in the body and is released into the environment. Though health officials insist that it is the first such case in the State, Savio says there was a patient next to him at the hospital who claimed he had tested positive for a second time. District Medical Officer K.J. Reena says it is the first such case reported here. “We cannot say whether it was a case of relapse or retained infection. Even a dead virus can be detected in a RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction test). But it is not infectious. We are yet to study post-COVID complications,” she says. “Remnants of the virus can exist in the body for more than 60 days,” says M.A. Andrews, Principal, Thrissur Medical College Hospital. “No test, whether antigen test or RT-PCR, is foolproof. There can be 30-70% error in tests,” he says.

Some of these are NTR Government Women’s Degree College, Mahabubnagar; Government Women’s Degree Colleges in Nalgonda, Karimnagar, Begumpet, Gajwel, Khammam, Nampally and Warangal.Many reasons could be attributed to this spurt such as free education, adoption of Information Communication Technology (ICT) methods and facilities for all round development of students. “Opportunity to join NCC and NSS as well as spacious playgrounds, libraries and laboratories and youth talent programmes like Jignasa are attracting students,” Mr. Surender Reddy said appreciating the contribution of Commissioner of Collegiate Education Navin Mittal in motivating teachers. “Mr. Mittal played a key role in creating the ICT facilities including digital classrooms. He also ensured that teachers reached out to students during the pandemic and classes were conducted to complete the syllabus using technology,” he said.“For the current academic year too, online classes and developing video lessons were carried out from August itself. Online classes for 3rd and 5th semester students are continuing,” said office-bearer of TGCGTA Pavani.

The South Central Railway (SCR) has been carrying 35,420 passengers daily through the 12 special trains to various destinations across the country and also through 16 more pairs of trains passing through the zone. Before the pandemic, the passenger count had been to the tune of 10.5 lakh a day! While the a crash in earnings from passenger fares is now accepted as certain by the railway authorities, what is interesting is that the number of reserved passengers, even when the 750 trains were running, has to be to the extent of 1.5 lakh only, claim senior officials. If about 1.5 lakh passengers travelled on MMTS suburban trains, the other seven lakh passengers a day used to travel in unreserved compartments.And, since the special trains were started, only reserved pre-booked passengers have been allowed to enter the stations and trains after adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols of thermal screening, social distancing, with no linen being provided and limited catering services available.The fixed number of trains and only reserved coaches showed that whatever earnings are obtained through fares are pretty consistent. For instance,it was ₹21.41 crore in June, ₹21.80 crore in July, ₹24.39 crore in August and 8 crore so far in September. Senior officials do not expect substantial change in the pattern in passenger transport unless the pandemic eases and more States permit the services.But, hope is on the freight and even if the last year's ₹9,000 crore revenue looks unlikely as of now, officials are confident of decent revenue by the end of the financial year as was indicated by general manager Gajajan Mallya during his virtual media interaction. About 158 special freight trains have been run from April, carrying 38,902 tonnes of material, third highest among all divisions till August.Apart from running three time-tabled parcel trains towards Howrah, Amritsar and Guwahati, a brand new freight terminal at Medchal got operationalised. Hitherto-neglected good sheds, where loading and unloading took place, were being modernised with 37 of the 136 by the railways and 32 with private sector participation, said Mr. Mallya. When compared to 2019, the SCR has managed to improve transport of foodgrains like rice, pulses, chillies, and turmeric along with fertilisers from 9% (4.5 MT) to 22% (6.9 MT); cement went up from 22% to 26% even though coal fell from 60% to 41%. Overall, this month 4.9 MT of freight was moved and it is slightly more than last year at same time at 4.8 MT which is an ""encouraging sign,"" said the officials.

The State also hiked testing in a 24-hour-period from 51,200 samples on Wednesday to 54,989 on Thursday. Cumulative cases stood at 1,54,456, and patients treated in hospitals at 45,919. Of these, 371 patients were critically ill and in ICUs, 96 of them on ventilator support.







The State’s toll was also surging, at 613 fatalities, with 21 more deaths added to the toll on Thursday. These occurred between September 4 and 22. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for 11 deaths, Alapuzha seven, while one death each was reported from Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode.Nearly 96% of new cases were locally acquired infections.

Cases were marginally higher than on Wednesday, but the numbers were lower than the preceding 10-day average. This was attributed to a protest by Karnataka health workers, which hit surveillance, testing and reporting. Fresh tests stood at 64,164, including 23,232 rapid antigen tests. Bengaluru Urban saw a record 4,192 cases. (With inputs from Vijayawada, Hyderabad and Bengaluru bureaus)

The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) Hyderabad has developed a low-cost rechargeable N 95 mask with an increased efficacy. This has been achieved by using graphene oxide-based paint on one of the layers of the mask.According to Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, regular N 95 masks filter particles which are 0.3 microns in size with an efficiency of 95%. “While the fibres of the mask pose as a mechanical barrier, an electrostatic charge on the surface of the mask traps particles. With usage, the electrostatic charge on the N95 masks erodes away, thus, decreasing the filtering efficiency of the mask. To address this bottleneck, researchers in TIFR Hyderabad have developed a low-cost rechargeable N95 mask,” a statement from TIFR reads. The mask is reusable after standard decontamination procedures without losing its efficiency. It can be recharged with small movements such as the movement of the jaw.The research was led by Dr. G. Rajalakshmi and Prof. T.N. Narayan along with graduate students Stelbin Peter Figerez and Sudeshna Patra. The researchers have also developed a device for testing masks for quality.

Benchmark stock indices slumped on Thursday taking a cue from the sell-off witnessed in the U.S. and European markets. The diversion of funds from secondary market to the primary market by investors seeking to bid in multiple Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) also added to the meltdown, analysts said, adding that the market would remain weak in the days ahead. The S&P BSE Sensex slid 1,115 points, or 2.96%, to settle at 36,553.60 points. Barring HUL, all the remaining 29 stocks in the 30-share Sensex ended with losses. Major losers included IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, M&M, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Tata Steel. The NSE Nifty also plunged 326 points, or 2.93%, to 10,805.50. Top losers included IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance, Grasim, and TCS. “Indian markets are following the global trend of sharp overnight sell-off in the U.S., EU,” Arjun Yash Mahajan, head — Institutional Business at Reliance Securities, said. “Asia opened weak and India followed the trend,” he added.“Additionally, if we see, foreign portfolio investors have been sellers for most of this week,” he added.IPOs sucking liquidity“Finally, the list of IPOs that have hit the market is also sucking out liquidity from the secondary market. Elections and other political events in the U.S. will continue to have an impact and act as an overhang. It may not come as a surprise if we see continued weakness in India for some more time,” Mr. Mahajan said. The selling pressure was widespread wherein IT, banking and auto were the top losers, Ajit Mishra, VP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd., said. He said the looming uncertainty over the stimulus package in the U.S., combined with the issue of rising COVID-19 cases worldwide, had raised concerns over the economic recovery. “And, it may deteriorate further if the virus situation results in partial lockdown,” he added.He said since Nifty had been down by nearly 6% this week so far that it would be prudent for traders to wait for clarity before jumping into a trade, while investors should continue to accumulate fundamental sound stocks on dips. According to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Service, as volatility is expected to be high, traders should remain cautious.

 The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has written to the RBI seeking changes to the central bank’s recent circular on current accounts. The rules, in their current form, may not only lead to a manifold increase in operational workflows, inefficiencies, delays, and costs for delivery of products, but also threaten the survival of smaller banks, CII said.The RBI in its August 6 circular mandated that no bank should open new current accounts for customers who had availed of cash credit (CC) or overdraft (OD) from the banking system. The RBI also said that for borrowers for whom the exposure was ₹50 crore or more, banks would be required to put in place an escrow mechanism, among other restrictions. The CII has pitched that the thresholds limits be increased from ₹50 crore to ₹100 crore, given the impact on MSMEs and to ensure minimal impact on the banking sector. “Similarly, decrease the banking exposure limit from 10% to 5% for clients availing CC/OD, or make limits consistent with Tier 1 Capital base to 15% of the bank’s capital to provide for a wider lender consortium,” the industry body urged. Further, it said certain categories of borrowers such as MFs, insurance companies, exchange brokers and NBFCs should be excluded from credit worthiness in terms of external ratings, given their high level of risk management and governance standards.The industry body has also sought time till April 1, 2021 to implement this circular given “client readiness, operational challenges and to allow for a measured and smooth transition” as against the current deadline of November 6, 2020.It also noted that banks had evolved specialised services like forex management and cash management by focusing on niche segments and investing heavily in technology to provide superior and customized services to the customers. “The circular would mandate the corporates to enter fresh arrangements with their lending banks irrespective of their ability to offer similar service and systems, which could significantly disrupt their business and profitability,” it said.Further, it added that concentration of funding and the concomitant pricing power would remain with a handful of banks which would create unfair pricing differentials. “The banks may move to fee-based model to offset costs of development and servicing. This will further make the corporate sector uncompetitive and increase the inefficiencies in the banking system, the cost of which would be borne by the corporate sector.”The circular would lead to denying the freedom to the corporate sector to decide on the Bank on merit of the service provided and be forced to choose from the banks providing CC/OD facilities.CII said that the current arrangement avoided over-dependency of clients on a single bank and multiple accounts were used for different functions / verticals within the business for smooth day-to-day operations. “Clients have their own liquidity and risk management frameworks to manage operational funds / investments through more than one bank. Having all CA balances concentrated in a single bank will lead to high risk and a lack of backup options under a business, operational or system failure of the lead bank,” it said.The industry body has recommended that the circular be restricted to corporates rated lower than BBB by local credit rating agencies. “As the intent of the circular is to mitigate intentional defaults, this approach will ensure that good corporates with a track record are not inconvenienced due to this guideline,” it said.

Corporate India has got three more months of relief from invocation of insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings by lenders, with the government extending the suspension of relevant provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) against firms defaulting on their loans since March 25 this year. The IBC’s invocation was first suspended for a period of six months in view of the emergent stress on balance sheets due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the national lockdown announced in March. The Corporate Affairs Ministry notified a further three-month extension on Thursday evening, when that six-month period was due to end. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the extension of the suspension of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the IBC reinforces the government’s commitment to protecting businesses. “It also gives companies breathing time to recover from financial stress,” she said in a tweet. The government had issued an ordinance to amend the IBC in June to enable the suspension of the Code’s provisions for firms committing defaults after March 25. The ordinance permits the government to extend the suspension of insolvency invocation for up to one year, and was passed as a legislation by Parliament this week.‘Result still elusive’“The notification was expected but the desired result is still elusive,” said Anoop Rawat, partner, insolvency and bankruptcy at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. “The rate of stress resolution outside IBC is abysmal and the stress is only accumulating,” he added. Mr. Rawat hoped the three months could be used to build stakeholder consensus on resolving the stress created on account of COVID-19 to avoid further build-up of stress at the end of the period. While the economy contracted more than 23% in the first quarter, when the harshest lockdown restrictions were in place, the industry is yet to see a significant revival in revenues as consumers remain cautious and hold on to cash amid a surge in novel coronavirus infections and dwindling jobs and incomes.The suspension of the corporate insolvency resolution process for another three months will help companies stay afloat, said Uttara Kolhatkar, partner at J. Sagar Associates. “The current COVID-19 situation has had a debilitating effect on the Indian economic situation and the passing of the Bill will give such stressed companies the much–needed cushioning effect,” she added.

The Telangana High Court on Thursday directed the State government to file a report on the reasons behind conducting lesser number of coronavirus confirmation tests in the State. Hearing a batch of PIL petitions relating to the COVID pandemic, a High Court Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy instructed the authorities to explain the steps being taken to enhance beds with oxygen facilities in different hospitals in the State. The government was unable to adhere to the assurances and statements given by it on COVID diagnostic tests, the Bench said. It noted that there were media reports galore on scarcity of beds with oxygen facility and lesser number of tests. Maharashtra was conducting 1.5 lakh tests on an average every day. Though the situation is not that severe in Telangana, the need to enhance tests in the State cannot be ignored. Not even 40,000 tests were being conducted in the State. The Bench suggested to the State government to ensure that at least three hospital beds were available for every 1,000 persons. It said that five hospital beds should be available for every 1,000 persons as per World Health Organisation (WHO) norms. But in Telangana State, not even a single bed is available on an average for 1,000 population, the Bench observed. Advocate General B.S. Prasad informed the court that detailed reports on the points raised by the Bench could not be furnished as Public Health director in-charge Srinivasa Rao’s father passed away recently. He sought some time to furnish all details pertaining to availability of beds and oxygen facilities in hospitals. The Bench posted the pleas to October 8 for the next hearing.

Several orphanages and children’s protection homes in Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri districts could face closure in a month’s time, owing to irregularities in functioning.Teams constituted by the Women Development & Child Welfare department have inspected all privately run protection homes in the three districts — 125 in Medchal-Malkajgiri, 65 in Hyderabad and 38 in Rangareddy. The process to issue notices is presently on.Almost 70% of the homes have been found with deficiencies, sources said. However, several of these shortcomings could be rectified, hence an opportunity would be given to the homes to improve. Where the conditions do not have any scope for improvement, and where irregularities are found, all such homes would be shut down, officials said. It is learnt that some homes were so bad that the teams had to immediately shift the children out, while caretakers of some others claimed that they were running hostels and would not come under the purview of the Women Development & Child Welfare department.The inspections have been taken up after a case of sexual assault surfaced at an orphanage in Ameenpur, where the victim, a minor girl, later died of various complications.Show-cause notices were issued to the staff of the District Child Protection Unit, for failing to inspect the home regularly. If their replies were found unsatisfactory, their services would be terminated, said officials.

A two-and-half-year-old boy with genetic liver disorder got a new lease of life with doctors of Pratima Hospitals doing a rare 18-hour operation on him and that too free of cost.Liver ducts affectedTejanshu, son of Lakshman and Rajitha from Jannaram mandal, Cherlapalli, was brought to the hospital with a rare disease called Congenital Biliary Atresia (CBA). In this disorder, liver ducts do not develop, and that leads to jaundice and liver failure. The team of doctors at Pratima Hospitals, Kacheguda, led by senior surgical gastroenterologist Ch. Madhusudan, and gastroenterologist and hepatologist B. Ramesh Kumar, successfully performed the live donor liver transplantation surgery. Donor father A portion of the liver was taken from the child’s father and transplanted on him, doctors said.In a statement here, the doctors said that doing a liver transplant in children is very difficult and needs high skills and expertise because children’s blood vessels are very tiny and lead to liver failure or surgery failure. The most important thing is the need to perform the surgery with minimal blood loss in children, and so we did it meticulously under a magnifying loop and we did it successfully, said Dr. Madhusudan assuring that in future too, they would do free surgical procedures for the needy. The little boy is active but needs regular follow-ups and immuno suppression drugs, the press release said.

The members of the COVID-19 coordination committee in Chittoor district have appealed to the people with symptoms of fever to aviod self-medication and undergo tests for coronavirus without delay. It has come to the notice of the coordination committee that many people with symptoms of fever, cold and cough had resorted to self-medication before they were tested postive for the virus. “We found that self-medication delayed the detection of the infection in many patients by a week or more and it led to serious health complications. This is one of the major reasons for the spread of the virus,” Indian Medical Association president (Tirupati region) P. Ravi Raju, who is a member of the COVID-19 coordination committe, told the media here on Thursday. The committee members are meeting regularly to discuss the spread of the virus and functioning of the COVID-19 facilities in the district. “The committe members, after a meeting here, said people taking self-medication was predominantly witnessed in the rural areas. Cases of people put under home isolation violating the norms have also come to our notice,” said Dr. Ravi Raju said.The officials working at the triage centers have been instructed to discourage the patients from rural areas to opt for home isolation. High recovery rate “At present, the district has around 10,000 active cases, of which 6,000 are under home isolation. Even as more than 56,000 cases have been reported from the district till date, the recovery rate of more than 85% is quite a relief. However, we should not be complascent and lay focus on checking the spread of the virus,” said Dr. Ravi Raju.Eighteen special teams of medical and paramedical staff have been working round the clock, covering the government COVID19 facilities set up at Tirupati, Chittoor, Madanapalle, Srikalahasti and Kuppam. Co-morbid condition The virus has claimed 620 lives in the district till date. “Majority of the victims had co-morbid health conditions who underwent tests much after they developed symptoms. “People with symptoms of fever should undergo tests without delay. This is the best remedy to arrest the spread of the virus. Early detection of the infection and timely treatment help can save more lives,” the IMA functionary said.

Deposition by children from the orphanage could become crucial evidence in the case pertaining to sexual assault in a protection home at Ameenpur, registered over a month and a half ago.The victim of sexual assault, a 14-year-old girl, died last month, while undergoing treatment at Niloufer Hospital.While the forensic science laboratory report is awaited to ascertain the exact cause of the girl’s death, it is reliably learnt that a few children rescued from the ‘Maruthi Orphanage’ deposed before the Judicial Magistrate of Sangareddy, confirming sexual assault on the girl.Officials hope that the statements could be a key evidence against the accused — a donor who frequented the home — and two caretakers. Besides, the committee constituted by the Commissioner, Women Development and Child Welfare for probing the case is learnt to have recorded corroborative evidence that confirms sexual assault. The committee, with members drawn from the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, WD &CW, and the Police department, has submitted its preliminary report to the commissioner. Final report will be prepared once the forensic test report arrives.Commissioner, WD & CD, D. Divya has reportedly written to the government, seeking appointment of a special public prosecutor to argue the case.The girl’s statement had already been recorded twice, once by the Child Welfare Committee of Rangareddy district, and then by the SCPCR in the government home at Nimboli Adda where the girl was given shelter after a police complaint was filed.In her statement, the girl pointed finger at primary accused Venugopal Reddy, who visited the home often as “donor”, and caretaker of the home Ch.Vijaya. The girl said she would be given cool drink and sexually assaulted after she lost consciousness. She would be woken up by other girls in the orphanage, to find herself naked in bed on fifth floor of the building housing the home. She was abruptly sent away from the home in April this year, on the pretext of pandemic spread. However, family members who took her home found that she was extremely sick, and, upon repeated entreaties, the girl confided in them. After a police complaint was registered, the girl was referred to the government-run protection home and when the situation worsened, she was taken to Niloufer Hospital, where she breathed her last. The orphanage was seized, and all other children there were rescued and shifted first to various private homes functioning under the WD&CW department, and later to the State Home premises in Yousufguda.

In a setback to trade unions, the Karnataka High Court on Thursday rejected their petitions challenging the legality of amendment made to the labour law extending flexible hiring facility under the ‘fixed-term workmen’ (FTW) policy to all industries.The court held that there was nothing wrong in the process followed by the State government in amending the Karnataka Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Rules, 1961, nor is creation of new category of employment under FTW contrary to the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act.A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order while rejecting the petition filed by Karnataka Industrial and Other Establishments’ Employees Federation.The petitioner had questioned the legality of the notification issued by the government in June making changes to rules to expand the facility of FTW to all industries as it was available only for the apparel manufacturing sector earlier.After perusing the records maintained by the government, the Bench declined to accept the contention of the petitioner that no consultation was held with the trade unions before amending the rules. The Bench said the process followed by the government adheres to the manner of holding consultation prescribed by the apex court while noticing that the objections filed by the trade unions to the draft rules were put up by the Commissioner of Labour before the government, which at three levels, Additional Chief Secretary (Labour), Minister for Labour and the Chief Minister had considered the common objections raised by the unions before approving the FTW rule.Also, the Bench said that the facility of FTW does not violate the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act as it creates a separate employment category on contract basis having pay and other facilities payable equal to permanent employees except that period of employment would not get extended. The Bench also found no merit in the contention of the petitioner that new law violates constitutional provisions.Employment under the FTW category allows flexibility for industries to hire and fire employees easily. It is seen as more flexible than the contract system, as it enables industries to hire people when a necessary arises and terminate their services when the necessity ceases to exist.

But the temple’s closure for six months and it now being opened only for darshan, sans special pujas, have meant a blow to the economy of several villages.When this reporter visited Tumari, there were hardly any hotels open. The owner of one hotel was preparing to wind up his business for the day as early as 9 a.m. “There are hardly any visitors. I prepared only dosa and sambar for the day. Our business depends on devotees visiting Sigandur temple,” said Krishna, owner of the hotel.A majority of the people on the island on the backwaters of Sharavathi are farmers. They have to cross the backwater with the help of barges to reach the mainland. For decades after the construction of Linganamakki dam in 1960s, they hardly saw any development. However, in the last two decades, Sigandur temple became popular, attracting devotees from different parts of the State. It brought in many changes to the lives of people there. “Around 20,000 people are dependent on the temple. Besides hotels, lodges, petty shops, there are around 30 jeep drivers, who carry visitors to the temple soon after they get down the barge. They have no source of income for months. Petty shops at Holebagilu and Kalasavahalli are closed,” said G.T. Satyanarayana, former president of Tumari Gram Panchayat. Meanwhile, the differences within the administration of the temple have prompted many people to urge the State government to take over the temple, which is right now handled by a private trust. Shivamogga district administration had submitted a proposal to the government for bringing the temple under the Muzrai Department in 2005 itself, but it has not happened since.

Booking of cases against two city-based jewellery shop owners by the Central Bureau of Investigation brings to the fore the fact of bullion traders taking loans several times more than the value of the yellow metal with a view to make a killing. All is fine as long as the bullion merchants, who speculate on the future price of the yellow metal in the commodities market, service the debts secured from commercial banks without any problem.They land in a serious trouble when the business plans go haywire. Their accounts turn non-performing when they are not in a position even to pay interest on loans as the price of the yellow metal turns volatile due to developments at the global level, police sources here say referring to the cases filed against Shantilal and Son Jewellers and Shanti Kalash Jewellers on a complaint from a public sector bank for alleged misappropriation of ₹70.13 crore. Banks prefer to sanction term loan as also overdraft facility to gold merchants in view of the reputation enjoyed by them in the society without fully understanding their business dealings which take turn for the worse in the wake of the fluctuation in the price of the precious metal, the sources say. Involvement of the loan sanctioning authorities in the banks could not also be ruled out, they add referring to the two cases wherein the owners had secured loan on the pretext of renovating their shops on the Achari street from the Canara Bank branch(then Syndicate Bank branch) at Dargamitta here.''We will extend all assistance to the CBI if sought to unravel the conspiracy in full,'' they add referring to the cases filed on complaints from the Stressed Management Branch of the bank.

Hours after a Kentucky grand jury brought no charges against Louisville police for Breonna Taylor’s death and protesters took to the streets, authorities said two officers were shot and wounded on Wednesday night during the demonstrations expressing anger over the killings of Black people at the hands of police. Interim Louisville police chief Robert Schroeder said a suspect was in custody but did not offer details about whether that person was participating in the demonstrations. He said both officers are expected to recover, and one is undergoing surgery. Several shots rang out as protesters in downtown Louisville tried to avoid police blockades, moving down an alleyway as officers lobbed pepper balls, according to an Associated Press journalist. People covered their ears, ran away and frantically looked for places to hide. Police with long guns swarmed the area, then officers in riot gear and military-style vehicles blocked off roadways. The violence comes after prosecutors said two officers, who fired their weapons at Taylor, a Black woman, were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend. The only charges were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside. No justice, no peaceThe FBI is still investigating potential violations of federal law in connection with the raid at Taylor’s home on March 13. Ben Crump, a lawyer for Taylor’s family, denounced the decision as “outrageous and offensive,” and protesters shouting, “No justice, no peace!” immediately marched through the streets. Scuffles broke out between police and protesters, and some of them were arrested.

In order to understand the diversity of behaviour among elephants and use the knowledge to reduce human-elephant interactions, the Forest Department has started profiling of individual elephants in Coimbatore Forest Division. In the initial stage, male elephants will be profiled using images of individual animals obtained using camera traps and cameras operated by the field staff. “Each elephant is different in terms of diversity of behaviour. The profiling helps to identify those elephants that are habituated to human habitats and engage in negative interactions. Such elephants account to a very minuscule population and targeted strategies can be applied to reduce their interaction with humans,” said I. Anwardeen, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle. Mr. Anwardeen had implemented profiling of elephants in collaboration with Shola Trust in Gudalur where around 150 elephants were photographed and profiles for 90 individuals were created in three years from 2015. The exercise had categorised elephants in four categories: transient ones that stay for a very short time during migration season, residents that are shy and never come to human habitation, brash youngsters that engage in crop raiding or attack people in conflict situation, and highly habituated old animals that stay close to humans but barely attack. Multiple photographs and observation notes of an individual elephant help to create a profile based on its height, age, shape of tusks, shape of tail, pattern of ears and other unique features. As part of the exercise in Coimbatore Forest Division, where 11 people were killed in elephant attacks and 20 elephants died of various reasons including gunshot in the current year, camera traps have already been placed in 20 key locations in different forest ranges.“Training for the profiling have been given to all the staff in the forest division ranging from anti-poaching watcher to foresters. Apart from the camera traps fixed in forests, the department has plans to buy cameras for the field staff for the purpose,” said D. Boominathan, landscape coordinator of WWF India, Coimbatore, which is assisting the Department in the log-term exercise. Places where camera traps have been fixed include Thadagam valley which witnesses movement of elephant to and fro Kerala. Cameras have also been fixed in Sirumugai, Periyanaickenpalayam and Karamadai forest ranges. According to the Forest Department, moving population of elephant is high in Coimbatore division which is located in the southernmost part of a larger landscape called south Nilgiri Elephant Range - 8 under Project Elephant. Range - 8 consists of two elephant reserves namely Nilambur elephant reserve and Coimbatore elephant reserve, overall elephant population is about 600 as per some studies.

India and Pakistan crossed swords over terrorism and Jammu and Kashmir at the Foreign Minister’s meetings of the 8-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the 27-nation Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). However, unlike similar occasions in the past, neither side walked out during the events held via video-conference on Thursday.Speaking at the South Asian meeting, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar called on all SAARC members to “collectively resolve to defeat the scourge of terrorism, including the forces that nurture, support and encourage an environment of terror and conflict, which impede the objective of SAARC to realise its full potential for collective collaboration and prosperity across South Asia”, without a direct reference to Pakistan.75th U.N. anniversary | India counters Pakistan’s J&K referencesVeiled reference to J&KPakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who also attended the meet along with the Foreign Ministers of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka, used the SAARC platform to make a detailed statement on the resolution of “long-standing disputes”, a veiled reference to Jammu and Kashmir and New Delhi’s 2019 move to withdraw Article 370.‘Unilateral moves’“The Foreign Minister said we must condemn, oppose any unilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of UN Security Council Resolutions,” the official Pakistan news agencies reported.The reports said Mr. Qureshi also referred to “systematic human rights violations of the people suffering from long-running disputes”.A similar statement was made at the CICA Special Ministerial conference, that brings together Asian nations ranging from Russia and Central Asia to the Gulf and South-East Asia.India rebutted Mr. Qureshi in its right to reply, said the MEA. “We advise Pakistan to cease its sponsorship and overt and covert support to terrorism against India,” India said.







 MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Pakistan’s statements at both events were “inconsistent” with the mandates of SAARC and CICA, where bilateral contentious issues are not raised. “What else can be expected of a country that indulges in cross-border terrorism as a part of its state policy,” Mr. Srivastava added.Last week, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had walked off from a virtual meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) after his Pakistani counterpart appeared with a Pakistani version of its map that included Indian territories. Last year, at the SAARC Foreign Minister’s meeting held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr. Jaishankar and Mr. Qureshi had boycotted each other’s speeches.PM Modi had also refused to attend the 19th edition of the SAARC summit, due to be held in Islamabad in 2016, over the issue of Pakistan’s continued support to terror groups.Speaking at the SAARC FM meet, however, Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali and Nepal’s Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi both said it is “imperative” to hold the SAARC summit.“The delay in convening the 19th SAARC Summit and the absence of formal meetings of the SAARC Charter bodies since 2016, has greatly impacted the functioning of our organisation,” said Mr. Gyawali, adding that this “has raised a serious question about the relevancy” of SAARC.However, sources said “most countries” agreed it is not the “opportune time” to convene the summit as proposed by Pakistan, given the COVID-19 situation, and the proposal “fell through”.All SAARC nations including India and Pakistan, however, built a common stand on the need to cooperate in battling the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Jaishankar listed a number of measures taken by India in the past few months including the SAARC Leaders video-conference convened by Mr. Modi, a ‘COVID-19 Information Exchange Platform (COINEX), a SAARC Food Bank mechanism, as well as the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund, to which India has contributed $10 million, making essential drugs, COVID protection and testing kits, amounting to $ 2.3 million available to countries in the SAARC region.

In fresh guidelines, the Collector said that if more than four confirmed cases were recorded in an area, it should be declared a containment zone. He also said that an aggressive containment strategy should be enforced where the number of confirmed cases were more. Employees of village secretariats should be used to conduct survey of primary and secondary contacts of the affected persons and home isolation marks should be put on their homes, he said. Those who have been infected should be treated at community health centres and area hospitals before being shifted to hospitals. The work related to setting up of oxygen lines should be completed immediately at Community Health Centres.Mr. Samuel also asked the Superintendent, GGH, to complete the process of recruitment of personnel in vacant posts.ArogyasriTaking serious view of some hospitals refusing patients under the Arogyasri, the Collector said that notices would be issued to those hospitals which refuse treatment and training should be provided to field-level staff on contact tracing and home isolation.Joint Collectors A.S.

Shots have been fired in the air on multiple occasions on the north and south banks of Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh recently, and the Chinese have been given a clear message that pushing back Indian soldiers physically will not work any more, a senior government official said on Thursday. Stating that once a melee happens, like the Galwan clash on June 15, opening fire was not possible, the official pointed out, “Now, we said, if you come close we will fire. Distance is dependent on the conditions like day or night, location and so on... If they are about to be overrun or in self-defence, troops are authorised to fire.”At the sixth round of Corps Commander talks early this week, India and China had agreed not to send any more troops to the frontline. “It is a good start. We have to wait and watch till there is concrete action on the ground, we will not lower our guard on the ground. Our stand is you moved first, so you move back first. That will be a good confidence-building measure (CBM),” the official said. The sixth round of senior-level military-level talks also saw a joint statement being issued as well as the participation of an External Affairs Ministry official who deals with China, the official stated. Earlier, the Chinese side had tried to project that India did not have a “unified” stance on the continuing boundary stand-offs. At the talks since the developments on the south bank since August 29, the Chinese want to resolve the latest incidents first, but India favoured a package resolution of the entire eastern Ladakh situation. “When we say status quo, what we mean is status quo before May,” the official stated. Chinese deaths The official revealed that the Chinese had conveyed through diplomatic channels that they had suffered five deaths, including their commanding officer, in the June 15 Galwan Valley clash, which left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead. Asked why the Chinese had acted in the way they did, the official felt there was “no one overarching reason” but many reasons, including turning Jammu and Kashmir into a Union Territory in August 2019 and also to divert attention from China’s COVID-19 crisis. Pointing out that the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in other sectors remains stable, the official said that local commanders on both sides were in contact and even they (the Chinese) had said: “Let not what’s happening in eastern Ladakh happen here”. Interestingly, in the eastern sector, Indian and Chinese troops patrol contentious areas by weekly rotation, a formula that could be brought into play in eastern Ladakh as well. The official asserted that there was no intelligence failure in detecting the Chinese movements in early May as they made ingress into the Indian side of the LAC. “Whoever moves first has the initiative and the first mover advantage,” the official, said stating they had been monitoring the Chinese all along. Currently, troops are facing each other at Depsang, the north and south banks of Pangong Tso, and Patrolling Points 17A, Rezang La and Rechin La. On possible collusion between China and Pakistan against India in the ongoing stand-off, the official said there was no major troop movement on the Line of Control (LoC), and only regular battalion movement was taking place. “Nothing unusual on that front. We don’t see any build on the other side. But terror activities continue. We are quite strong on the ground, so we eliminate the threat on the LoC,” the official said. On the global support to India in the ongoing stand-off and the transgressions by China and engagement with Quad countries, the official said: “At the end of the day, you have to fight your own battles”. On the situation in the Depsang plains, where Chinese troops continue to block Indian patrols to the Patrolling Points 10-13, the official said there were one or two Chinese vehicles near the Y-junction, which kept going back and forth. Beyond the Y-junction, Indian patrols had to go on foot, which were being blocked by Chinese vehicles, the official stated, adding that patrol parties followed protocols and returned. “We have not given up our claims. It has only been temporarily halted due to the circumstances,” the official said.

 Manufacturers of corrugated boxes are facing steep increase in cost of raw materials and other inputs and are thus staring at huge losses, according to the Indian Corrugated Case Manufacturers’ Association. The Indian corrugated box industry, with over 350 automatic corrugators and more than 10,000 semi-automatic units, has seen kraft paper mills increase prices steeply and other conversion input costs spiralling. Overall, there is 18 % to 20 % hike in input costs. The kraft paper mills say that price of domestic and imported waste paper has increased in the last two months. Since China proposes to ban waste paper imports with effect from January 1, 2021, it is consuming the supplies available now in the global market and this has pushed the prices up. Further, with lockdowns all over the globe due to COVID-19, generation of water paper has fallen. The Indian paper mills could not import adequate volumes during lockdown periods resulting in lower inventory of required grades and shortage in some lower grades. Sandeep Wadhwa, president of the Indian Corrugated Case Manufacturers Association, appealed to the kraft paper mills to stabilise the prices and to ensure that supply chain in not hampered during the recovery phase. Harish Madan, vice president of the Association, said that unless the box users, including large FMCG brand owners, support the industry, its survival will be difficult.

Sir Harold Evans, a British-American Editor whose 70-year career as a hard-driving investigative journalist, magazine founder, book publisher and author made him one of the most influential media figures of his generation, died on Wednesday at the age of 92. Evans died of congestive heart failure in New York, according to his wife Tina Brown. A former editor of Britain’s Sunday Times and, at his death, Reuters editor-at-large, Evans put a unique stamp on investigative journalism. Championing causes either overlooked or denied, he and his team uncovered human rights abuses and political scandals, and advocated for clean air policies.One of his most famous investigations exposed the plight of hundreds of British thalidomide children, who had never received any compensation for their birth defects. Evans organised a campaign to take on the drug companies responsible for manufacturing the drug, an effort that eventually won compensation for the families. “All I tried to do — all I hoped to do — was to shed a little light,” Evans said in an interview with the Independent in 2014.After 14 years at the Sunday Times, Evans became editor of the Times of London shortly after media mogul Rupert Murdoch purchased the paper in 1981. Evans left a year later in a dispute with Murdoch.Evans received one of the highest honours of the British monarchy when he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2004 for his services to British journalism.He penned several books, including The American Century and its sequel They Made America, as well as an ode to good writing called Do I Make Myself Clear?.

(CIWMCPL), that processes about 50% of the city’s waste in Vellalore had sent the notice a few days ago asking the Corporation to pay at least ₹ 15 crore by the end of this month or treat the notice as a preliminary intimation for termination of contract. The Corporation, the company, said owed it ₹ 56.93 crore. The company’s letter has the Vellalore residents worried, who say their situation could go turn worse if waste processing is stopped. CIWMCPL stopping waste processing will result in Corporation dumping an additional 500 tonnes mixed waste in the Vellalore yard. Or, in other words, the Corporation will be dumping the entire city’s waste, 1,000-odd tonnes a day, in the yard, says J. Daniel of Vellalore Kuppaikidangu Ethirpu Kuzhu (a residents’ collective opposing the mismanagement at the dump yard). More unsegregated waste means more pollution, more odour, more flies, and more people turning sick, what with the North East Monsoon season only a couple of weeks away. This clearly shows that the Corporation has not prioritised the welfare of the Vellalore residents and reflected the civic body’s poor financial health, which is a result of mismanagement. V. Eswaran of MDMK, who took the Corporation to the National Green Tribunal, says the failure to pay the company its dues only showed the failure of Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani. The Corporation that spends hundreds of crores of rupees in Smart Cities Mission projects is unable to find money to pay the waste processing contractor is surprising, Mr. Eswaran says and points out that waste accumulation in Vellalore will not only pose a threat to the Vellalore residents’ health but also impact the integrated bus stand project. He says the MDMK will not hesitate to mobilise the residents to stage a protest to draw the State Government’s attention. Echoing similar opinion, DML MLA and former Coimbatore Deputy Mayor N. Karthik says the Corporation mismanaging solid waste management and its poor financial health squarely reflected Mr. Velumani’s failure as Municipal Administration Minister. When the Corporation started the solid waste management project for around Rs.100 crore in 2010 when the DMK was in power in the State, the civic body created awareness among residents, distributed bins and paved the way for a successful waste management project. That the Corporation has almost derailed the project in the last nine years only shows the AIADMK government’s failure. In a related development, the Corporation has paid ₹ 50 lakh to CIWMCPL, sources say and add that this was no way close to the ₹ 10 crore that the company had demanded by September 20.

The Assam government has informed a UAPA tribunal that major extremist outfits of the northeast had contacted Chinese authorities for assistance in their “fight against India” but the Chinese had refused to provide assistance directly or indirectly.The affidavit filed by the Assam government before the tribunal in May, said the United National Liberation Front of West of South East Asia (UNLFWSEA), a Myanmar-based conglomerate of banned outfits such as the NSCN-K, ULFA-I, NDFB-S and KLO, had taken a resolution “to take assistance from third nation” to fulfil and achieve their goal. The conglomerate was formed in 2015. The affidavit is not clear on when it approached the Chinese authorities. “Accordingly, UNLFW first preferred China to seek for assistance. Paresh Baruah and Yung Aung @ Thoiba contacted Chinese authority. However, the Chinese refused to provide assistance directly or indirectly,” the tribunal’s order quoting Assam government’s affidavit said. Baruah is the leader of anti-talks faction of United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA). He is wanted in India for a number of cases such as attacks on security personnel, kidnapping and extortion, and is said to shuttle between Taga in Myanmar and Yunnan province in west China. He has a Red Corner notice issued against him by the Interpol. Yung Aung is a leader of National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang faction. The tribunal was constituted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) after the Union Home Ministry extended the ban on the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) in November 2019 for five years. On September 22, the tribunal after examining the case, upheld the ban and declared NDFB as an “unlawful association for a period of five years”. ISI steps inAfter the Chinese refused, “as an alternative, UNLFWSEA looked for establishing nexus with Pakistan at any cost at the earliest,” the affidavit said. “It was learnt that Pakistan (ISI) was providing all sorts of assistance to all outfit groups fighting against India. Pakistan (ISI) was offering assistance to such groups financially, providing arms ammunitions and explosives. Pakistan (ISI) desired such groups to destroy more and more Indian government‘s properties, railways, bridges, Army, Police and security forces, oil refineries and other government properties. However, the plan could not be executed due to two main reasons – i) impeachment of Khango Konyak from NSCN(K) and ii) Attack in Taga Camp by Indian and Myanmar Army jointly,” the affidavit read. The planning was done between July 15- August 1, 2018 during the tenure of Khango Konyak’s chairmanship of NSCN(K). the affidavit said. The Union Home Ministry informed the tribunal that since 2015, NDFB was involved in killing of 19 civilians. It said NDFB was involved in 62 violent incidents in which 55 extremists have been killed, 450 extremists arrested and 444 arms recovered.Large scale surrendersSignificantly, after the Ministry banned the NDFB in November 2019, on January 11 this year, several leaders and cadres from all factions of the NDFB “crossed over to India from their base camps in Myanmar” to join peace talks with the Centre. A tripartite suspension of operation agreement was signed between Union Home Ministry, Government of Assam and factional head of NDFB. On January 27, a Memorandum of Settlement was arrived among the various NDFB factions, All Bodo Students Union (ABSU), Assam government and the Union Home Ministry.Union Home Minister Amit Shah who presided over the event in Delhi said the agreement would “end the 50-year-old Bodo crisis.”“Today, Assam is united. Around 1500 cadres of NDFB(P), NDFB(RD) and NDFB(S) will be rehabilitated by Centre and Assam Government. They will be assimilated in the mainstream ….No one will be called a militant now, they all are our brothers and sisters,” Mr. Shah had said.NDFB was first declared as an unlawful association in 1992 and the ban was extended from time to time. 2,823 civilians, 239 security personnel and 939 Bodo cadres have been killed so far. The outfit later split in four factions.The Assam government said activities of the NDFB were aimed at “asserting itself as a group that continued with the armed struggle for sovereign Bodoland.”The NDFB's counsel told the tribunal that the UAPA provisions are not applicable to the disbanded organisation as all its members had surrendered and disbanded the outfit according to the terms of the Memorandum of Settlement.The Assam government said the ban was necessary as the cadres had deposited only 38 pieces of arms with 1,558 ammunitions during surrender ceremony. “Further they have also not submitted their final list of cadres to the government despite several communications made to them. In view of above developments, there is every likelihood that these disgruntled residual leaders and cadres of NDFB who are still taking shelter on foreign soil may reorganise the organisation NDFB and continue secessionist and subversive activities in future in collusion with the like-minded extremist outfits of the North-East,” the Assam government said.

The word Azhvar means one who is deeply involved in something. To be involved in something, one must like it. Secondly, one must get an opportunity for involvement. And finally, and most importantly, the thing one is involved in must be something that engages one for a lifetime. It must not be something temporary, here now, gone the next minute. And given the nature of the mind, it is difficult for us to find something that holds our attention always. The mind has, after all, been likened to a monkey, which cannot stay in one place for long, but keeps jumping about here and there. The only thing that is capable of lasting forever is attachment to Lord Narayana. Once one realises that there is nothing worth thinking of than the Lord, the involvement begins and never goes away.We see this in the case of Pillai Urangavilli Dasar, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse. Initially, he was enamoured by the beauty of his wife’s eyes. He would walk in front of her, holding an umbrella to shield her eyes. Ramanuajacharya asked him if he would give up this obsession, if he (Ramanuja) showed him something more beautiful. Pillai Urangavilli Dasar agreed. Ramanuja showed him the beauty of the eyes of Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam, and Pillai Urangavilli Dasar became a slave to Ranganatha’s charms. So, he reached the point where he focused on the indestructible, whereas earlier he had focused on the temporary. But God’s guiding hand is what takes us to the point where we see Him as our only refuge. If Dasar had not been in Srirangam, and if Ramanuja had not witnessed the odd sight of a man guarding his wife’s eyes, the transformation of Dasar would not have happened. Both divine will and an Acharya’s guidance are necessary for us to take the right path.

 The Congress on Thursday said it was all for speedy justice in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case but disapproved of the emotive issue eclipsing pressing concerns of Bihar such as recurring floods, unemployment and problems faced by farmers. Addressing a press conference in Patna, AICC general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said the party would like the CBI to complete its inquiry in three months and favoured setting up of a special court to facilitate expeditious trial.Also read: Deepika Padukone, Sara Ali Khan, Shraddha Kapoor and Rakul Preet Singh summoned in drug nexus case “We understand the pain that the untimely death of a son of the soil might have caused. His family has a right to seek justice and it is good that their wish has been granted. But let us not lose focus because of this issue. Let us not give an escape route to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is driving a jhooth ki railgaadi (a train carrying falsehoods) and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who has happily agreed to become one of its passengers”, Mr. Surjewala said. He was responding to queries about relentless attacks by the ruling NDA in Bihar on the Shivsena-led government in Maharashtra in which the Congress is a partner. Governments of both the States have been engaged in a tug of war ever since the father of the Patna-born actor lodged an FIR, accusing actress Rhea Chakraborty of abetting the suicide and the Mumbai police of paying no heed to his complaints.Also read: Something rotten: On Sushant Singh Rajput death and the media mob When the Bihar police began probing the matter and, later, when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar recommended a CBI probe, the Maharashtra government came out strongly in support of Chakraborty’s contention that the home State of the deceased actor, with whom she was in a relationship, had “no jurisdiction” in the matter. The contention was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court. Though the NDA leaders have said that Rajput’s death case is not an election issue, but considering sentimental attachment of citizens of Bihar with the matter, the issue becoming a campaign talking point in the upcoming State polls can’t be ruled out. Mr. Surjewala also dismissed reports about a rift in the Grand Alliance in Bihar and pointed out that the Congress was joined by its partner RJD in opposing the farm Bills. “Our in-charge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil and State unit chief Madan Mohan Jha are present here. In a few days from now, they will start unveiling before you the strategy we intend to adopt for ousting the Nitish Kumar government from power,” he said.Sushant Singh Rajput: Life and death in the spotlight Hindustani Awam Morcha, an important constituent of the Opposition grouping, has already walked out of the coalition and another partner RLSP of former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha has asserted all is not well in the grand alliance. Mr. Surjewala reiterated the Congress’ contention that the recently passed farm Bills would deprive cultivators of benefits such as minimum support price (MSP) and help big corporates in gaining an undue advantage. The Congress leader said the party was, therefore, extending its support to the “Bharat Bandh” called by farmers’ bodies on Friday, besides launching it’s own agitation programmes.

U.S. President Donald Trump failed to commit to the peaceful transfer of power when asked a question on the subject on Tuesday, adding to concerns that the post-election scenario in November might be chaotic. “Well, we’re going to have to see what happens. You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots and the ballots are a disaster,” Mr. Trump said in response to the question.The President, in a bid to question the legitimacy of postal ballots, has been complaining for months about vote by mail, including by making unsubstantiated claims about the incidence of voter fraud (orchestrated by Democrats).All States use some amount of mail in voting but the COVID-19 pandemic has meant an expansion of the process across the country. Vote by mail has already started for the elections, and at least 75% of Americans will be eligible for a postal ballot as per a New York Times study.“Get rid of the ballots and you’ll have a very peaceful... there won’t be a transfer frankly, there’ll be a continuation,” Mr Trump said when the reporter further pressed him on whether he’d commit to a peaceful transfer of power in light of the fact that “people are rioting.”In an interview to Chris Wallace of Fox News, Mr. Trump had in July said he would “have to see” when asked if he would accept the November election results. In 2016, running against Hilary Clinton, Mr. Trump had given a similar answer to the question.Supreme Court pick Mr. Trump also stated on Wednesday that he wanted to replace liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg before the November 3 election as he expected a dispute over the results . Mr. Trump is expected to announce his pick on Saturday, a pick that is likely to further solidify the conservative majority of the court.Former (2012) Republican presidential nominee and U.S. Senator from Utah Mitt Romney, who had voted to convict Mr. Trump on impeachment charges earlier this year but has also said he will consider a Trump nominee for the Supreme Court, reacted strongly to Mr. Trump’s comments on Wednesday.“Fundamental to democracy is the peaceful transition of power; without that, there is Belarus. Any suggestion that a President might not respect this Constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable,” Mr. Romney wrote on Twitter.‘Not surprised’Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden reacted to Mr. Trump’s comments and said he was not surprised, while implying a challenge to the peaceful transfer of power was not something that happened in the U.S.“What country are we in? “Mr. Biden told reporters in Delaware. “He [Mr. Trump] says the most irrational things. I don’t know what to say... but it doesn’t surprise me.”“The American people will decide this election. And the U.S. government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House,” the Biden campaign said in a statement issued on Wednesday.

If all goes as planned, by the end of the year, as many as 10 Dry Waste Collection Centres (DWCCs) in Bengaluru will be semi-mechanised with improved facilities. This is part of an initiative by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to upgrade all 120 centres at a cost of ₹65 croreThe centres are being upgraded along the lines of the unit at Marappanapalya ward, which received a facelift after Hasiru Dala, a non-government organisation working on waste management, collaborated with a Netherlands-based firm. The civic body chose 10 DWCCs in Atturu, Yelahanka Satellite, Jakkur, Kuvempu Nagar, Nagawara, H.B.R. Layout, Rajamahal Guttahalli, Koramangala and Kengeri (159) wards for the first part of the upgradation at a cost of ₹4.75 crore. “Work on the DWCCs at H.B.R. Layout and Koramangala wards have been completed,” said officials in the BBMP’s Solid Waste Management (SWM) cell. Two centres are likely to be ready by the end of September. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the project by a couple of months, an official said but added that it is now back on track. The BBMP decided to upgrade the DWCCs last year after an audit of all the centres in the city. The audit was taken up to understand the gaps that exist with respect to operations – from infrastructure, capacity to the financial model. The audit had revealed that 23 DWCCs were unfit for operation, 68 needed minor renovation while 52 could be expanded.Around 120 DWCCs were servicing 126 wards. “With the new garbage tenders stressing on separate collection and transportation of different streams of waste, there is a need for all wards to have a DWCC,” said Sarfaraz Khan, BBMP’s Joint Commissioner (SWM).Officials had been directed to identify locations for setting up new DWCCs in the 78 wards. “The locations are likely to be finalised by the year-end,” Mr. Khan added.

The IPL lost one of its side attractions on Thursday. Dean Jones' untimely demise has robbed the tournament of one of its most perceptive and entertaining commentators.It may be no exaggeration to say that Jones the commentator had more followers in India than back home in Australia. Remember how he used to dress up as an academician during his stint as Professor Deano for NDTV?He extended Australia's long tradition of excellent cricketers-turned-commentators. The likes of Ian Chappell, Richie Benaud and Bill Lawry elevated Channel 9 and now Brett Lee, Jones’ colleague on Star Sports Dugout, is a delight too.Jones, however, had to live through one terrible phase when he was sacked by Ten Sports after he made an insensitive description of Hashim Amla during the second Test between Sri Lanka and Australia at Colombo in 2006. He regretted his mistake and was able to win back the broadcaster's faith.

 Jones could put a smile on the viewer's face, with his sense of humour. He would also showcase his knowledge of Hindi, like if 52 was needed for victory, he would say: “They now need to make baawan.”Scott Styris, former New Zealand all-rounder and now a fine analyst, always managed to bring the best out of Jones. During a recent IPL broadcast, Styris was talking to Lee about the speed of pace bowlers. “I was happy with my bowling,” Styris said. “The batsmen were also happy with your bowling,” quipped Jones.It is hard to believe Jones is no more. You will be missed, Deano!

China is running hundreds of detention centres in northwest Xinjiang across a network that is much bigger than previously thought, according to research presented Thursday by an Australian think tank.The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) said it had identified more than 380 “suspected detention facilities” in the region, where China is believed to have held more than one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim Turkic-speaking residents.The number of facilities is around 40% greater than previous estimates, the research said, and has been growing despite China's claims that many Uighurs have been released.Using satellite imagery, eyewitness accounts, media reports and official construction tender documents, the institute said “at least 61 detention sites have seen new construction and expansion work between July 2019 and July 2020”.Fourteen more facilities were under construction in 2020 and around 70 have had fencing or perimeter walls removed, indicating their use has changed or they have been closed.Beijing on Thursday again denied the existence of detention sites. The government says they are vocational training centres used to counter extremism.Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin called ASPI “the vanguard of anti-China forces whose academic credibility is seriously questionable”.U.S. lawmakers recently voted to ban imports from Xinjiang, citing the alleged use of systematic forced labour.Beijing recently published a white paper defending its policies in Xinjiang, where it says training programmes, work schemes and better education mean life has improved.‘Training camps’It claims to have given “training sessions” to an average of 1.29 million workers each year between 2014 and 2019.Following the publication of the ASPI report, the Chinese government-controlled nationalist tabloid Global Times cited “sources” as saying contributors Clive Hamilton and Alex Joske were banned from entering China.Mr. Wang did not confirm if the two academics had been banned on Thursday, but said the matter was “totally within the scope of China's sovereignty”.

The indefinite strike by Karnataka State Health and Medical Education Department Contractual Employees’ Forum and Karnataka AIDS Prevention Society Contract Workers’ Association has partially hit COVID-19 surveillance, testing and reporting in the State. Over 30,000 employees affiliated to these associations abstained from work starting Thursday demanding pay parity and COVID-19 incentives. While the government has announced COVID-19 incentives for doctors and paramedical staff working under the National Health Mission, it has excluded a majority of staffers on COVID-19 duty. Protesting this disparity, NHM staffers deployed at Primary Health Centres, taluk and district hospitals apart from COVID-19 Care Centres did not report for work on Thursday.The protest’s impact was also visible in the COVID-19 health bulletin issued by the Health Department on Thursday. The State reported 7,710 new cases and 65 deaths. Although this is marginally higher than that reported on Wednesday, the numbers are lower than average, which is attributed to the protest.The total cases went up to 5,48,557 and the toll rose to 8,331. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths. With 6,748 discharges, the total recoveries rose to 4,44,658. Of the remaining 95,549 active cases, 827 patients are being monitored in ICUs of various hospitals.The number of tests continued to remain lesser that the average 75,000 per day. Only 64,164 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 23,232 rapid antigen tests. Bengaluru Urban saw a record 4,192 cases, the highest single-day spike so far.

In a year of grim tidings, the demise of Dean Jones in Mumbai on Thursday is the latest hammer-blow. Sport has lost an effervescent cricketing star, who made a smooth transition to the commentary box with his swagger and zest intact.During his prime, the former Australian batsman was all energy and aggression.He exuded an aura in One Day Internationals (ODI), with shots that blended the conventional and the unorthodox while embellishing it with frenetic running between the wickets.Jones, Deano to his friends, was a sharp fielder too and he was part of the 1987 World Cup-winning squad helmed by the indomitable Allan Border.The Madras classicAfter a tearful Kim Hughes resigned and left the reins of a weakened Aussie unit to Border in 1984, the latter identified Jones as one of his vital cogs, who along with David Boon, Geoff Marsh, Steve Waugh and Craig McDermott, could revive Australia.Jones and ODIs shared an adrenaline-loaded bond but he is often remembered for his rousing 210 in the famous Tied Test at Chennai, Madras then, in 1986.






One of the defining pictures of the historic Tied Test was Dean Jones battling heat and dehydration to rack up a superb 210.  






   The enduring images of him batting relentlessly despite the southern metro’s searing heat, egged on by a ruthless Border, is the stuff of legend.Jones later admitted that he urinated in his pants, vomited on the turf, but soldiered on as his captain wanted him to stay at the wicket.The Test’s anniversary recently passed us by and just as those old pictures of Jones emerged, he now lies cold in Mumbai. Life’s myriad turns could not be starker!Broadcast embraceAfter a decade of cricket for Australia, the Victorian embraced television, became a perennial fixture in commentary boxes, forged new friendships and was always eager to have a chat.He could be politically incorrect too and a ghastly word he used to describe South African great Hashim Amla, put Jones to pasture. He apologised profusely and reintegrated himself with the media bandwagon that tails the willow game.At 59, he had many years of good talk and booming laughter left in him but his heart deemed otherwise and cricket is poorer.

Six months after lockdown was imposed and restrictions continued to combat the COVID -19 pandemic, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation’s (TSRTC) buses will hit the roads in Hyderabad from Friday. The move comes a day after the transport juggernaut resumed its suburban services outside the city. According to a statement issued to the media, while city bus services will resume, they will be limited given the fact that the Telangana government has approved only 25% of its fleet of around 3,200 city buses to ply the roads. Operations will resume in a phased manner.The decision was taken after Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao chaired a high-level meeting with Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar. Deliberations included the number of buses which would be pressed into service, and on which routes. Apart from city buses, inter-State buses – to Maharashtra and Karnataka – will also resume operations.The CM has instructed that all COVID – 19 precautionary measures and rules be strictly followed.Once the announcement came later in the evening, executive directors, divisional managers, depot managers and other TSRTC officials and workers across city depots began to put plans into action. They took stock of the buses parked in various depots and decided which ones to be pressed into service.A day earlier, the corporation resumed its mofussil services, to areas such as Pochampally, Kanakamamidi near Moinabad, Choutuppal, Kothur, Rajendranagar, Shankarpally, and Jahangir Peer Dargah on Shadnagar Road, among other places.According to officials, as a part of the mofussil bus services, which is calculated as city limits plus 16 km, around 230 buses were pressed into service. “There are no bus passes such as student pass or any other kind of pass for mofussil services. While the occupancy on the first day was low, we are sure that this will increase as the days pass,” a TSRTC employee said.

A group of eminent academics, writers, filmmakers and artists from around the world, including Noam Chomsky, Salman Rushdie and Mira Nair, on Thursday called for the release of former Jawaharlal Nehru University students’ leader and activist Umar Khalid, who has been arrested by the Delhi Police in connection with the riots that erupted in February.“As an international community of scholars, teachers, students, artists and film-makers, we have watched with alarm the events unfolding in India. We stand in solidarity and outrage, with the brave young scholar and activist Umar Khalid, arrested in New Delhi on September 14, 2020, under fabricated charges of engineering the Delhi riots in February 2020”, a statement issued by the group said.Mr. Khalid had been charged with sedition, conspiracy to murder, and under sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the statement noted.“This process of criminalizing all dissent has been underway for a few years and even under a COVID-19 pandemic, relentless political arrests under fabricated charges are punishing the innocent long before they are brought to trial”, it stated.The statement raised the question: “What was Umar Khalid’s crime?”It said, “That he used the passion of his commitment to his country, marshalled his education and his voice to join the movement for equal citizenship, against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA]; this law introduced religion as a criterion for citizenship, and has no place in a secular nation”.CAA threatThe CAA, along with the proposed National Register of Citizens, threatened the citizenship of millions of the poorest in the country, particularly targeting Muslims, it alleged.“Much like Black Lives Matter, the movement against CAA-NRC with full participation of all democratic rights actors, was led by those most affected-Muslims and especially Muslim women; students across universities, regions, classes and religions played a leading role”, it said.Mr. Khalid had become a powerful voice in the movement and had spoken at nearly 100 meetings. “Today, Umar Khalid joins a long list of those targeted, implicated and unjustly incarcerated under UAPA, only because they were active in the equal citizenship movement, against the CAA-NRC”, it observed.Kapil Mishra’s speechThe group said that BJP leader Kapil Mishra had not faced any police scrutiny despite threatening that his supporters would take matters into their own hands if the anti-CAA protesters were not removed.“This speech is widely alleged to have triggered the violence between 23 and 26 February 2020. Instead, young protesters have been targeted and thrown into jail...We call on the Government of India to: Free Umar Khalid and all those falsely implicated and unjustly incarcerated for protesting against the CAA-NRC that denies equal citizenship rights and ensure that the Delhi Police investigates the Delhi riots with impartiality under the oath they took as public servants bound by the Constitution of India”, it added.Among the signatories were Angela Davis, Rajmohan Gandhi, Cornel West, James Galbraith, Amitav Ghosh, and Arundhati Roy.

The COVID-19 epidemic is plotting a path almost similar to the projections which spoke of a possible peak in the epidemic curve mid-September to the first week of October.The exponential rise in the case graph was evident with the State registering 6,324 cases on Thursday, quite a jump by over 1,000 cases registered the previous day. The State also hiked the number of samples tested in the past 24 hours from 51,200 on Wednesday to 54,989 samples on Thursday. However, it is not quite clear what proportion of these tests are done in the private sector.The number of recoveries reported on the day was 3,168.The cumulative case burden now stands at 1,54,456. With 1,07,850 recoveries reported so far, the number of patients currently undergoing treatment in hospitals is 45,919. Of these, 371 patients are critically ill and in intensive care units, with 96 patients on ventilatory support.The State’s death toll is also surging steadily in proportion to the rise in the total number of cases and now stands at 613, with 21 more deaths being added to the official toll on Thursday. These are deaths which occurred between September 4 to 22. Thiruvananthapuram accounted for 11 deaths, Alappuzha 7, while one death each was reported from Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode.Close to 96% of the new cases —6,054 out of the 6,324 new cases reported on Thursday — are locally acquired infections, including infections reported in 105 health-care workers. In 628 of the cases, the source of infection remains unknown. The sudden rise in the number of cases put Kozhikode with 883 new cases at the top of all districts.

Kerala will take the lead once more in bringing together other State governments and experts to deliberate on the Goods and Service Tax (GST) compensation and its implications.The move comes in the wake of the State rejecting the two options put forward at the GST council on August 27. Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had last month chaired a meeting of Finance Ministers of Punjab, Delhi, Chattisgarh, West Bengal and Telangana and decided to reject the two options.Amidst reports that more States are towing the line of the Centre and that the GST compensation would be delayed for States not choosing either of the two options, the new initiative is to organise a webinar jointly by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation (GIFT), Thiruvananthapuram, and the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID) Chandigarh on September 28. Official sources said the aim was to provide a forum for deliberating on the implications of the Centre’s proposal on the already stressed State finances and articulate the responses of the States. The Finance Ministers of West Bengal, Delhi, Punjab, Jharkhand, Punjab and Puducherry have already agreed to attend. Amit Mitra, Finance Minister of West Bengal, and Chairman of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers on GST, will chair the morning session. In the afternoon, eminent academicians and captains of the media will deliberate on the issue.Kerala wants the Centre to take loan and provide GST compensation due to the State and it has been communicated in writing. The GST compensation due to the State is ₹7,000 crore. The first option mooted by the Centre is to provide a special borrowing window to States in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India to provide ₹97,000 crore at a reasonable interest rate. The other option is to meet the entire GST compensation gap of ₹2.35 lakh crore this year itself after consulting the central bank.

The Uzhavar Sandhai that was shuttered here as part of COVID-19 containment measures will be reopened in the same location only after number of cases returned to zero. The farmers’ market has since been relocated to two different locations, with the breakup of stalls. The Uzhavar Sandhai that was a huge draw among Hosur residents was shuttered pre-emptively to avoid an outbreak, especially due to its location. The old farmers’ market was sited on a location with a narrow approach road causing heavy congestion. In its wake, the market was closed to avoid build-up of clusters taking cue from the experience of Koyambedu cluster.The market was bifurcated with number of stalls divided to be set up on the road abutting Ramanayakkan Lake and at the MGR market for another group. Amid queries of the relocation of market back to its original spot, the corporation has no plans of moving the market back to its erstwhile location as the number of cases in Hosur was steadily spiking on a daily basis. According to Hosur Corporation Commissioner Balasubramaniam, for now, the Uzhavar Sandhai will continue to operate from its two temporary locations. “The market will not be moved back, until the number of cases came down to zero.”

Issues relating to services of outsourced workers of sanitation department in GHMC, who had been working for long, can be resolved through One-Time Settlement, Telangana High Court on said. Hearing a writ appeal filed by the GHMC challenging a single judge order to regularise services of 98 sanitation workers, a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy sought to know what was wrong with the order. If the posts of sanitation workers were temporary, why were they being make to work for several years, the bench questioned. Recently, a single judge directed GHMC to regularise services of 98 outsourced sanitation workers and pay minimum time scale salaries to them. All the arrears should be paid by September 15, the order said. Challenging this direction, the GHMC filed an appeal. Senior counsel S. Niranjan Reddy, appearing for GHMC, contended that petitioners were not GHMC regular employees. They were not appointed by the civic body and were hired by an outsourcing agency, he said. GHMC was paying wages to nearly 30,000 persons. If outsourced workers were to be paid on the lines of regular scale, it would be a huge financial burden on the civic body, the lawyer said. However, the bench observed that government wings were not expected to exploit workers in the guise of outsourcing. If the posts were temporary, why the services of the workers were being availed for years together, the bench remarked. The single judge’s observation that government and its organisations cannot indulge in exploitation of labourers by not paying minimum wages cannot be found fault with, the bench said. The counsel appearing for GHMC sought time to file a detailed counter affidavit in the matter. The matter was posted to September 29 for next hearing.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is the latest agency to turn its gaze on the actors and party organisers who have been arrested by the Central Crime Branch (CCB) in connection with an alleged drug racket. But this time, it’s the financial activities of the accused that are under the scanner. The ED on Thursday obtained permission to question actors Ragini Dwivedi and Sanjjanaa Galrani as well as three others for alleged money laundering. During the bail application hearing in the NDPS Court, Special Public Prosecutor P. Prasanna Kumar filed an application seeking permission for the ED to question the accused about their financial activities. Admitting the plea, the court granted the agency permission to question party organiser Viren Khanna, another accused Rahul Thonse, second division clerk in the RTO Ravishankar as well as Ragini and Sanjjanaa for five days at Central Prison, Parappana Agrahara where they are lodged.Mr. Prasanna Kumar submitted that the CCB, during the course of its investigation, found that the accused financed drug trafficking and earned money from the activity. The ED, through its counsel, stated that in order to unearth and trace the financial trail, it was essential to know details of the property purchased by the accused and investments made. The counsel cited the recent suspension of Assistant Commissioner of Police M.R. Mudhavi for allegedly helping the accused in return for a payment of ₹50 lakh. He allegedly received ₹12 lakh as an advance from the accused. “With this, it can be estimated that the accused have huge amount of unaccounted money, which needs to be probed,” Mr. Prasanna Kumar said. Resort owner summonedCCB officials, as part of the investigation, summoned Bengaluru-based resort owner Karthik Raju for questioning. According to the police, the accused had organised a party at his resort where drugs were sold and consumed. “We are probing in detail to ascertain his possible involvement in the racket,” a senior police officer said.CCB special teams are still searching for three of the prime accused, including Aditya Alva, the son of the late Jeevaraj Alva who served as minister, and party organiser Sheikh Fazil.Accused tests positiveOne of the accused arrested by the CCB has tested positive for COVID-19. According to the police, he is one of the party organisers who is close to several celebrities. “CCB officials had taken him into police custody for further questioning but on Thursday, his results came positive. He has been shifted to a private hospital for treatment,” said a senior police official.

The Union Health Ministry on Thursday admitted that 10 States and Union Territories account for 83% of the new deaths due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, with Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal leading the list. India has registered 1,129 COVID deaths in the past 24 hours, as per data released by the Health Ministry.The other States/UTs on the list are Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and Haryana.A senior Health Ministry official added that these were also the States where the Ministry has ramped up testing. Across India, 11,56,569 tests have been conducted in the past 24 hours, and the total number of tests crossed 6.74 crore on Thursday.“India has substantially ramped up its testing infrastructure across the country. Currently, there are 1,810 labs [testing for COVID-19], including 1,082 government and 728 private labs. In the past 24 hours, testing has been the highest in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Odisha,” said the senior Health Ministry official.A release issued by the Health Ministry said that for the sixth consecutive day, the number of new confirmed cases has been lower than new recoveries. “A total of 86,508 new cases have been reported in the last 24 hours in the country,” it said.Meanwhile, 75% of the new confirmed cases are also concentrated in 10 States/UTs, said the Ministry, with Maharashtra continuing to top this list. “It [Maharashtra] has alone contributed more than 21,000 [cases] followed by Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka with more than more than 7,000 and 6,000 cases respectively,” the release said.Coronavirus India lockdown Day 182 updatesIn its response to a Lok Sabha question earlier this week, the Health Ministry said that in the un-lockdown phase, a total of 13,76,090 persons have been brought back from various countries (as reported on September 20), and their return followed up. “A total of about 40 lakh persons have been kept under surveillance,” it added.Replying to a question on diseases that may have been neglected due to the pandemic, the Ministry said that the tuberculosis notification (in which TB is diagnosed in a patient, reported within the national surveillance system, and then on to the World Health Organization) for January 2020 to August 2020 was 11,76,164, whereas from the same time period in the previous year (January 2019 to August 2019) the notification was 16,49,310.“Currently, there is no evidence to suggest an increase in the incidence of TB cases as a result of the pandemic,” said the Ministry.It added that under the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), a decline has been noticed in the number of individuals attending HIV counselling and testing/screening centres during the COVID-19 pandemic.“This is due to the lack of transport services and reduced mobility thereof. During March-July 2020, around 1.4 crore HIV testing has been reported under NACP facilities in comparison to 2.32 crore testing in March-July 2019. As a result of decrease in testing/screening, detection of new HIV cases has also reduced,” the Ministry admitted.“During period of March-July 2020, there has been around 41.40 thousand HIV positive results at NACP facilities, down from 82.20 thousand HIV positive results in corresponding months of 2019,” the Ministry said. “As of now, the current evidence does not anticipate an increase in HIV incidence as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the uptake of HIV/AIDS services, the NACP has issued guidance notes to all States/Union Territories’ AIDS Control Societies (SACS) to facilitate continuity of HIV prevention, testing and treatment services as much as possible through differentiated modalities like multi-month dispensation of anti-retroviral treatment (ART), community-based screening for HIV, and decentralised options for management, including enabling directives for commodities transportation,” it added.

The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court on Thursday quashed the FIR and the chargesheet filed against Myanmar nationals booked for Tablighi activities and said, “Compelling the applicants to undergo the trial would cause grave injustice.”On September 21, a division bench of justices V.M. Deshpande and Amit B. Borkar was hearing a plea filed by eight nationals. They landed on March 22 and from March 24 till March 31 they were sent to institutional quarantine despite testing negative for COVID 19. On April 5, they were booked under the Foreigners Act, Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act for quashing the FIR and chargesheet. They were also booked under several sections of the Indian Penal Code.The State government argued that after the tourists arrived in India they started preaching activities and participated in religious activities violating conditions of the visa manual. On July 21, a chargesheet was filed based on statements of witnesses and other evidence collected by investigating agencies claiming that there is ample material on record to prosecute the applicants.The advocate appearing for the applicants said all of them are not conversant with the local language; they had studied the Quaran and Hadis in their language. There is no material produced by the prosecution to prove that they were engaged in tabligh work and they were involved in preaching religious ideology or making speeches in religious places. There is no material produced by the prosecution in the chargesheet, which even prima facie proves contravention of the visa manual.The court said, “We are of the opinion that the investigating authorities acted without jurisdiction in registering the FIR under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) based on a complaint by the police. The investigation conducted by the police was also without jurisdiction.”The 20 page order read, “We are of the opinion that allowing the prosecution to continue would be nothing but an abuse of the process of the court in as much as there was an express legal bar against the institution of FIR against an accused based on the police report. Compelling the applicants to undergo the trial would cause grave injustice.”While quashing the FIR and chargesheet, the court noted, “There is no material on record to prove that applicants had indulged in any act which was likely to spread infection of COVID-19. Therefore, from the material produced in the chargesheet, there is no evidence to substantiate the fulfilment of ingredients of Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.”

 The State government has again sanctioned food kits to 1,000 transgender persons. The State had become the first to provide food kits to transgender persons in the first phase of lockdown in March. With the spike in disease, transgender persons have been facing a difficult time. The government has now sanctioned food kits to the tune of ₹700 each to 1,000 transgender persons who have ID cards, those who have completed screening for the cards, and those who have applied for it. However, this number forms only a small percentage of the total number of transgender persons in the State. A socio-economic survey in 2014-15 had estimated the number of transgenders in the State at 25,000. They have been further pushed to the margins of society by the pandemic. Apoorva, a transgender person, used to work as a cook at the Social Justice Department’s shelter for transwomen at Karakkamandapam here but after it closed down, had no income. Consequently, Apoorva had to move back home with her parents. She is also worried about how to meet the hospital expenses of her parents. Ruby, who too had worked at the same shelter home, had taken up fish business. But after a friend died, all the savings were wiped out. She has not been working since. The rent on her house has been adjusted against the advance, but with no money in hand, she has no option but to move out the next month. Community members say the food kits provided by the government or the assistance of ₹1,500 provided by the National Institute of Social Defence are only a drop in the ocean. Some have got a breather after shifting to the shelter homes run by the community under a government project. The increase in funds sanctioned for sex reassignment surgery from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh and self-employment loans announced by the KSWDC are welcome steps, but financial assistance is necessary to tide over the difficult times, they say. Their hopes are now pinned on a proposal for government assistance of ₹1,000 for 800 transgender persons.

Illegal sale of pan masala and gutkha seems to have resurfaced in different parts of the city.As per the State government order that came into effect in 2013, sale or possession of pan masala and gutkha is a punishable offence and no one should stock the substance.The police conducted a raid in January and seized 700 kg of gutkha and other banned chewable tobacco products from a godown and a person was arrested for stocking it at Palpannai. The Tiruchi Corporation and the Food Safety and Drug Administration Department conducted a few raids recently to detect sale and possession of the banned items.Yet, they are sold in select shops discreetly, regular customers say. Unlike in the past, no shop keeper displays packets containing the banned items. The sellers conceal the product and sell them only to known and regular customers. Unknown customers asking for the product are turned away. Since the customers, who have been addicted to chew the gutkha items, were desperate to buy them, the petty shop owners cash on the demand and sell them at the price fixed by them. Lack of enforcement mechanism and absence of sustained action are understood to be factors that have prompted the traders to sell them.“We will not be able to get the banned items for a short period after a raid or arrest of sellers. In general, they are available in most of petty shops. Of course they are sold secretly,” says a customer, who bought a sachet of gutkha at a petty shop in Cantonment.When contacted, R. Chithra, Designated Officer, Food Safety Department, said that there had been no let up in action against those illegal sellers. More than 350 cases were registered during the last two years in Tiruchi district. About 10 tonnes of gutkha and pan masala substance were seized in 2 years from different traders. Of this, seven tonnes of gutkha packets was destroyed a few months ago. This month alone, 700 kg of banned items were seized from various traders.“The traders and petty shop owners follow innovative ideas to store and sell the chewable items. Raids will be intensified,” Dr. Chithra said.

 Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Bhaghel on Thursday said the farm Bills passed in the Parliament are against the interests of farmers and if needed, the Congress may move court against their implementation. He also said that if required, the Congress may stall their implementation in the party-ruled States. The Congress has always fought for farmers and labourers and will continue doing so, Mr. Baghel said while addressing a press conference in Nagpur, Maharashtra, on the issue of farm Bills passed in Parliament.Explainer | Why are the Agriculture Bills being opposed The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were recently passed by both the Houses of Parliament, amid protests by Opposition parties. Asked if the Congress would decide on not implementing the Bills in the party-ruled States, he said, “If required, we may take this decision. We are pursuing it stepwise. We have appealed to the President to return the Bills.” “This decision (passage of Bills) is against the States, farmers and consumers. Whatever that a State government can do under its jurisdiction, we will do. If needed, we will not let the Bills be implemented in our (Congress-ruled) States,” he said. Mr. Baghel also said that if required, they will approach court as the States were not taken into confidence before the passage of the Bills in the Parliament.Read farm Bills before stoking fears that farmers will suffer: Jal Shakti Minister tells Opposition “We have appealed to the President and the Narendra Modi government not to implement the Bills. Many Bills get passed, it is not necessary that all should be implemented. These Bills are also not in the interest of farmers and should not be implemented,” the Congress leader said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is giving “one shock after another” - in the former of demonetisation, GST, lockdown, where crores of people became jobless and were forced to walk back to their native places, and now farm Bills which is a “black law”, Mr. Baghel said. Slamming the ‘one nation-one tax’ regime of GST, he said, “We have not received the GST difference amount from April this year.” “We should have received about ₹3,000 crore from the Central government which we have not received till now and they want us to borrow money from banks,” Mr. Baghel said. He also slammed the government over the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, alleging that it was a conspiracy to put the farming sector into the hands of private players, who will “decide the price of food grains and promote hoarding”.

With a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in the State, the demand for medical oxygen has shot up by over 150 metric tonnes in the last one month. The current availability for medical purposes is 375 metric tonnes per day.While it had increased from 120 metric tonnes per day on an average during the pre-COVID-19 period to nearly 450 metric tonnes per day till August, the current demand is nearly 600 metric tonnes per day. Doctors handling critical COVID-19 patients said the consumption per patient per day has increased from six litres two months ago to nearly 30 litres. Gaurav Gupta, Principal Secretary, Commerce and Industries, who is monitoring the oxygen supply chain in the State, told The Hindu on Thursday that there has been a substantial rise in oxygen consumption over the last one month. “Although the cases have surged, there have been an equal number of recoveries. However, more hospitals, especially in the districts, have converted normal beds to oxygen-equipped beds. They increased the number of high-flow devices, like ventilators and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) equipment, in the ICUs,” he said.“We have progressively curtailed industrial consumption to make more oxygen available for medical purposes. On an average, we are diverting nearly 200 metric tonnes of industrial oxygen per day for medical use. We are carefully monitoring the production and supply on a daily basis. The focus is on ensuring uninterrupted supply of oxygen so that no patient suffers because of lack of oxygen availability,” said Mr. Gupta, who is also the BBMP Administrator.Raising the issue during the video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had said it was important to “incentivise” industries to set up new oxygen generation units. “While the current availability is sufficient for the time being, the peak demand of medical oxygen is calculated to be about 870 metric tonnes per day as Karnataka will have some 31,000 oxygenated beds in government hospitals alone,” the Chief Minister told the Prime Minister urging the Centre to rope in more industries to meet the demand.“When the pandemic began, the State had nearly 7,000 oxygenated beds in government hospitals. This has been increased to about 18,000. More than 10,000 of these beds have been reserved for COVID-19 patients. Apart from this, another 4,250 oxygenated beds have been reserved for COVID-19 patients in private hospitals,” the Chief Minister apprised the Prime Minister.Sources in the State Drugs Control Department told The Hindu that there is a need to increase the production of hospital-level oxygen generation units. “While there is adequate availability as of now, there are issues with transportation and storage at the hospitals. We have seven manufacturing plants and 47 refilling units. We are initiating measures to increase production in the coming days,” sources said.Price riseFollowing increase in demand, the price of oxygen being supplied to hospitals has also shot up. R. Ravindra, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said bigger hospitals that have a long-term contract with suppliers are not facing any issues. However, smaller hospitals with short-term contracts or those who want new contracts are forced to pay double the price, he said.Although the Centre has capped the price at ₹17.49 per cubic metre plus GST, hospitals are forced to pay around ₹40 per cubic metre, he claimed “We are unable to manage with the ₹7,000 package fixed by the State government for an oxygenated bed for government-referred patients. We will meet soon to discuss this and seek an enhancement in the rate,” Dr. Ravindra said.

Advocate Ejaz Maqbool, who represents the Jamiat petition and is led by senior advocate Dushyant Dave in court, said in the letter that the case was deleted from the list in the morning. He said the remark about the transfer of the case to “court number 31” was “erroneous”. A list on the court website shows only 10 virtual courts, including the Registrar court, functioning.The letter addressed to the SC Registry said the media portrayal of a section of the population has affected lives and livelihoods. “It is relevant to note that this matter is of utmost urgency as there has been a demonisation of a large section of Indians due to the communal twist given to the Nizamuddin Markaz issue, which is affecting the life, livelihood and dignity of such persons so much so that their shops/businesses are being boycotted, they are being attacked, and in some cases even being refused treatment by doctors,” the letter read.In his e-mail to the Supreme Court Registry, Mr. Maqbool also pointed out that the case was supposed to have been listed on September 23, going by an earlier order. Virtual Benches, however, sit in batches on alternative days. The CJI Bench did not sit on September 23.The letter said the pleadings in the case are complete. The parties are ready for final arguments. It urged the Registry to list the case on September 25 for final hearing or on “any other convenient date”.

The Communist Party of India (CPI) on Thursday accused Central law enforcement agencies of acting in a politically partisan manner against the State government by attempting to cast it under a permanent pall of doubt in the UAE consulate linked gold smuggling case. Indicating that the LDF would fight the move politically, CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran said overlapping investigations by multiple agencies appeared to hover over the Secretariat without making any headway. Customs was a Central subject. Gold smuggling was primarily a failure of the Central government.The agencies had not questioned persons who sent the contraband to the country via air freight addressed to the UAE consulate here citing diplomatic immunity. The investigators were undecided whether the contraband came in regular cargo or diplomatic baggage. However, the investigations appeared politically primed to lay down a smokescreen of lies to destabilise the LDF government. The Centre had tried a similar tactic in Congress-ruled Rajasthan recently. It had used the CBI to undermine the non-BJP government. The Rajasthan government banned CBI from setting foot in the State. Kerala has done no such thing. It had welcomed the probe instead. The government had not commented on the probe because it did not want to upset delicate Centre-State relations. However, political parties had their say in the matter, he said. Mr. Rajendran said the possibility of admitting Jose K. Mani faction of the Kerala Congress (M) into the LDF would hinge on whether the group would part ways with the UDF for good. Mr. Mani, currently a UDF Rajya Sabha MP, is aligned with the UPA at the Centre. He has said his faction would reveal its stance at the ""opportune moment"". The LDF is in no hurry. Nobody had walked into the LDF one fine day. The INL waited for years before it became part of the coalition. Mr. Rajendran was dismissive about Mr. Mani purported political heft in central Travancore. ""I am from Kottayam. The CPI has its ear on the ground and knows the electoral field,"" he said.Mr. Rajendran said Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel should have publicly appeared for questioning in his official vehicle. The CPI was part of the LDF and not a corrective force as portrayed by some sections of the media. Earlier, Mr. Rajendran had chaired a meeting of the party's State executive after a hiatus of three months.

Sunglasses maker Ray-Ban's parent company Luxottica was attacked by a ransomware on Sunday, information security manager Nicola Vanin confirmed in a Linkedin post.Worldwide operations of the world's largest eyewear company were affected, although no employee or user data was lost, Vanin noted.The breach led to the temporary shutdown of operations in Italy and China.The Milan-based company employs over 80,000 people and houses popular eyeglasses brands including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Ferrari, Bulgari, Chanel and Armani. A ransomware is a malicious software that infects systems and demands their users money for it to work again normally. The malware can creep into systems through infected links, emails or by accessing other websites.Users said the websites for Ray-Ban, Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, EyeMed, and Pearle Vision stopped working on Friday, Bleeping Computer, a cyber news portal, reported.Other Luxottica portals like 'one.luxotrica.com' and 'university.luxottica.com' were also under maintenance.Luxottica had a vulnerable Citrix ADX Controller device, popular among ransomware threat actors. When exploited, the vulnerability provides access to a network and credentials that can be used to spread further through the network, security firm Bad Packets stated.

Mangaluru City Corporation will begin imposing fine for non-payment of property tax for 2020-21 financial year from next month, according to Mayor Diwakar.Addressing presspersons here on Thursday, the Mayor said that the deadline extended in July for paying tax without 2 % as fine gets over by this month-end. The deadline had been extended by the government in view of the COVID-19 situation.The Mayor said that of the total property tax demand under the self-assessment scheme (SAS), only 23 % has been collected so far. Hence, the civic body is requesting property owners to pay tax at the earliest.He said that the issue of anomalies in water bills issued to consumers will be addressed in the monthly Water Adalats which will resume next month. Based on consumer complaints, the corporation has learnt that 30 % of the water bills issued had abnormal bill amount charged.

The civic body will, however, not reveal the identity of the complainant.The Mayor said that the corporation will launch a campaign in the city next month to persuade people to wear masks in public places.He said that the civic body was soft on street vendors who have occupied footpaths in the city in view of the hardship they faced due to COVID-19 for the last five months. Now, it can no longer allow them to occupy footpaths as economic activities have picked up. They will have to vacate within a week. Otherwise, the corporation will evict them.Deputy Mayor Vedavathi, Whip in the council Premananda Shetty and chairpersons of standing committees were present.

The government’s claim that the protection of Minimum Support Price (MSP) for farmers would continue in spite of the new farm laws is a half truth, according to Congress spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Abhishek Singhvi.Also read: Congress to launch nationwide stir against agriculture legislationsIn the first of a series of nationwide press conferences that the party plans to hold over the next one month in its campaign against these laws, Mr. Singhvi said the farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, did not explicitly mention MSP anywhere. The government’s claim was technically correct, that these laws did not explicitly say that the provision of MSP had been removed. But the laws gave the freedom to buy and sell the produce at any cost. “The government’s half-truth is far bigger than any lie”, he stated. Picking other flaws in the Bills, he said that they gave licence to hoarders. They had liberalised the farm sector, allowing the corporate sector to purchase directly from farms and there was no dispute resolution mechanism in case the farmer felt short-changed, he observed. These laws, Mr. Singhvi asserted, were unconstitutional, as they legally infringed on the division of power set out by the Constitution between the State and the Centre. Research study on BiharSenior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh posted a 2019 study by the National Council of Applied Economic Research on Bihar, where, in 2006, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act was abolished. He tweeted, “Bihar abolished the APMC Act in 2006. That is one argument made by the Government in defence of the 2 #FarmBills. But what exactly did that abolition achieve?” The main five findings of the report were: it led to a deterioration of public infrastructure, situation of small and marginal farmers remained unchanged as they continued to sell their produce to village-level intermediaries, left a regulatory vacuum in the State and poor public procurement, increased the number of intermediaries and did not attract large-scale private sector investment.

After two accused in the Nagercoil sexual harassment case were granted bail, as the CB-CID had failed to file a final report within the mandatory time period, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday observed that the final reports in such sensitive cases should be filed on time.Justice V. Bharathidasan took into account the fact that nearly six criminal cases were pending against Kasi, key accused in the case, and at least 120 women had been affected. No final report was filed by the CB-CID in any of the cases.Both his associates, Desan Jino and Dinesh, were granted bail.The court, which had summoned the DSP, CB-CID, Kanniyakumari district, and the Investigating Officer, said this was unfortunate. The officials were present during the hearing.Kasi was detained under the Goondas Act on the ground that he was a habitual offender and had indulged in activities prejudicial to the maintenance of public health and public order. It was said that he had befriended women from affluent families, sexually harassed them and extorted money.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is all set to file FIRs against four private hospitals for allegedly failing to comply with the directions of the State government and reserve 50% of their beds for COVID-19 patients.BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, on Thursday, announced that he has written to the jurisdictional police to file cases under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act. “Many hospitals gave us details of the bed count, including those reserved for dialysis, neonatal care and emergency. However, we were not satisfied with the explanation of these four hospitals,” Mr. Prasad said.Testing to be doubledHe added that during a video conference on Wednesday, attended by the Chief Minister and other senior senior officials, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, directions had been issued to reduce the COVID-19 positivity rate and mortality rate. “Bengaluru was directed to bring down the positivity rate to 5% and mortality rate to less than 1%. Currently, the positivity rate is 13.48% and mortality rate is around 1.4%,” he added.Increasing the number of tests was the only solution to reducing both positivity and mortality rates. “The BBMP is conducting around 20,000 tests a day while private laboratories and hospitals are conducting around 5,000 tests a day. Both these numbers should double,” he pointed out.The BBMP plans to have stricter monitoring protocols for COVID-19 patients in home isolation. As many as 58% of the total patients in the city are in home isolation.Mr. Prasad said focus will be given to testing residents in micro containment zones. He noted that stigma had reduced to some extent after the BBMP had stopped barricading and putting posters on the door of homes where residents had tested positive for COVID-19.

 Several Indian students are among over 200 overseas student signatories of a letter delivered to the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson at Downing Street in London on Thursday, seeking justice in the wake of being accused of cheating in a compulsory English language test six years ago. The scandal, believed to have impacted around 34,000 international students, relates to the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC), a compulsory requirement in some student visa cases. Many of the students caught up in the row are Indian and have consistently maintained their innocence and have been lobbying the government for a chance to prove their innocence. We were innocent but our visas were refused or revoked and the government gave us no way to defend ourselves. Our futures were destroyed and we were left to fight a years-long legal battle costing each of us tens of thousands of pounds, reads the letter. We write to you because it is within your power to right this wrong, to put an end to our detention, deportation and humiliation. Allow us to prove our innocence by establishing a free and transparent scheme — independent of the Home Office — through which we can get our cases to be reviewed and clear our names, they wrote in a direct appeal to Mr. Johnson. The group has been supported in its long-running campaign by Migrant Voice activists and several parliamentarians including Labour Party MP Stephen Timms, Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on TOEIC. In the letter to the U.K. PM this week, they also sought to highlight how their plight has been magnified during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “The coronavirus pandemic has made our situation even worse. Our support networks have collapsed, the charities we rely on have been closed, our friends and families are unable to help as they are struggling themselves. We are terrified of catching the virus and being hospitalised, or dying with a black mark still against our names. This is not the future we wanted or worked for,” they write. “Several reports over the years, including by the U.K.’s National Audit Office and House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC), have flagged flawed evidence used by the Home Office against the affected students and raised serious doubts over the decision to revoke or refuse tens of thousands of visas.” “These students have been living a nightmare for six years. Stripped of their rights and their futures destroyed, many are destitute and suffering severe mental health problems. There is a mountain of evidence that proves they are victims of a mammoth injustice – and the government can ignore this no longer,” said Nazek Ramadan, Director of Migrant Voice. The issue dates back to February 2014, when BBC’s ‘Panorama’ investigation uncovered evidence of organised cheating in two English language test centres run on behalf of the Educational Testing Service (ETS). This included providing English-speakers to take speaking tests instead of the real candidates and staff reading out multiple choice answers for other tests. The U.K. Home Office responded vigorously, investigating colleges, test centres and students and cancelled thousands of visas in the wake of the expose. It has maintained that the courts consistently found that the evidence it had at the time was sufficient to take action and that the 2014 investigation into the abuse of English language testing revealed “systemic cheating“. Last year, the influential PAC parliamentary body had issued a harsh rebuke of the government’s reaction to the scandal. The Home Office’s pace of response to the issue of cheating has either been ‘full throttle’ or ‘too slow’, with no middle ground. It has been quick to act on imperfect evidence, but slow in responding to indications that innocent people may have been caught up in its actions, noted the report titled ‘English Language Tests: A Systemic Failure Affecting Thousands.’ “We are staggered that the Department thinks it is acceptable to have so little regard for the impact its actions might have on innocent people,” it said.

It is high time that investigating agencies like the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) act like Chanakya to remove the menace of narcotics from the grassroots, the Karnataka High Court said while taking note of high-profile drug peddling cases in recent days.“There is a trend of inculcation of drugs, ganja and other such substances in society by various transactions. It has created a menace for society. Such things are to be dealt with an iron hand. They [drug peddlers] could not be spared even for a while,” the court observed.Justice B.A. Patil made these observations while quashing a seven-year-old case registered against a man for allegedly possessing dry leaves of cannabis (ganja).Observing that nowadays high-profile drug peddling is increasing, the court said that increasing circulation of drugs would seriously affect society, particularly harming the younger generation, college-going children, besides promoting other crime. The menace of drugs, which affects the future of youngsters, will have to be removed from the root like Chanakya “who removed the stump of grass from the root as it obstructed his movement,” the court observed. However, the court absolved accused Abdul Saleem, a resident of Lakkasandra, of the charge of possessing ganja as he had only been found possessing dried leaves dark brown in colour when the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, defines ganja as “flowering or fruiting tops of the cannabis plant (excluding the seeds and leaves when not accompanied by the tops).” Moreover, the court also found that there was no report of chemical analysis to indicate that the leaves contained 25% tetrahydrocannabinol to call it ganja as per the provision of the Act.

Residents of some villages have taken objection to the State government’s plans to form residential layouts in villages surrounding Belagavi city, saying that they would lose their fertile land.They said that the Belagavi Urban Development Authority was making efforts to acquire land in 28 villages for creating layouts.This issue was raised in the taluk panchayat meeting here on Tuesday. Some members said that gram panchayats in all the 28 villages had received notice about land acquisition for construction of residential layouts for urban residents. Taluk panchayat president Shankargouda Patil said that a resolution would be passed against this and sent to the State government. However, BUDA officials refuted this. “No notice has been sent for formation of layouts. There is a proposal before the State government to expand the jurisdiction of BUDA. That is yet to be approved,” a senior BUDA officer said. “There is no plan or proposal for acquiring land for residential layouts in any of the new areas, as of now,” BUDA Commissioner Preetam Naslapure said. BUDA, one of the biggest city development authorities in the State, has a spread of over 192 square kilometres. It stretches from villages such as Kakati and Kangrali on one side and Savgaon, Mandolli and Peeranwadi on the other. When expanded, it will encompass the Belagavi airport in Sambra, Yallur, Navage and Kadoli on the four sides. The proposal has been forwarded by the district administration to the State government. Once the new areas are included, then the rules set by BUDA on land use and house construction will have to be followed. Regulations on creating new layouts and residential and commercial complexes will also have to be adhered to. A vision document is being prepared, along with a comprehensive development plan. A detailed plan of the city will be prepared using Geographical Information Systems, under the Centrally aided AMRUT Scheme. BUDA’s plans for layout development under the farmers partnership scheme is also being opposed. The urban body plans to take over farm land from those willing to sell, develop it into layouts and offer half of the number of sites developed to farmers so that they can sell them to whoever they want. BUDA will, however, allocate its sites to those who apply for them, under government rates. It has an on-going project on Kanabaragi Road that was challenged in court earlier. It has been cleared now and BUDA will develop the layout in 140 acres, excluding the 160 acres that is under dispute. Similar plans are afoot in Jhadshahapur, Hindalga and Anagol villages. A few days ago, residents of Anagol and Halaga villages submitted a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner’s office urging the government to drop the idea of creating residential layouts in these villages under farmers partnership scheme. Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath has assured them of looking into their concerns.

A day after the monsoon session of Parliament ended amid a flurry of protests by the Opposition over three farm Bills, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar demanded that the Congress first disassociate itself from its own 2019 poll manifesto that promised the same agricultural reforms as done by the Modi government. “If Rahul Gandhi agrees with the Congress manifesto of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, then he should join efforts in educating farmers,” Mr. Tomar said.Addressing a presser at the BJP headquarters here, Mr. Tomar reiterated the government’s commitment to farmers’ welfare and said the new measures would bring them remunerative price for their produce. He also said the government was open to holding talks with farmers to assuage any doubts among them on the efficacy of the reforms. “If any farmer wants to speak to any government representative on these Bills even at midnight, we are ready,” he said.Responding to the demand by the Opposition that continuation of the minimum support price (MSP) should be mentioned in the law, he said the MSP was always an administrative decision. “Why did the Congress not bring a law during its 50 years of rule if it thinks this was necessary,” he asked. He also cited reports of various commissions and reported views of Sharad Pawar, who was Agriculture Minister in the UPA government, to assert that these Bills are in line with their recommendations.‘Withdraw manifesto’Asked about Mr. Gandhi’s charge that the Modi government had harmed farmers and was now doing “PR”, Mr. Tomar said the Congress leader should first withdraw his party’s manifesto if he wanted to oppose the Bills.The new laws will allow farmers to get paid for their produce in advance, help them move products which will fetch them better price and allow them to sell their produce outside agriculture ‘mandis’ without paying any taxes, he said.“Farmers, so far, were forced to sell their produce in mandis. In Punjab, there’s 8.5% tax in the mandis on several items. Now, through these Bills, the farmer will be able to sell his produce even outside the ambit of the mandi, even outside his State at any price he chooses,” Mr. Tomar said.Parliament has passed the three farm reform Bills — the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill — in the session, which concluded on Wednesday. They will become laws after getting the assent of President Ram Nath Kovind and being notified.

 Amidst strong indications about the Kerala Congress (M) led by Jose K. Mani set to align with the Left Democratic Front (LDF), the faction has suffered a major blow with senior party leader and three time legislator Joseph M. Puthussery quitting the party to join the rival faction led by P.J. Joseph.Announcing the decision here on Thursday, Mr. Puthussery told media persons that he wanted to follow the political probity of K.M. Mani and those who followed the footsteps of the KC(M) patriarch could never align with the LDF. “Even though Mr. Mani had severed ties with the UDF in 2016, he then chose to come back soon,” he said.He further criticised the Mani group's decision to forge ties with the LDF, which had made K.M. Mani a target of political witch hunt during the bar bribery case. “Ironically, those who claim the legacy of K.M. Mani are joining hands with the LDF after his demise. This is going to be suicidal. People who love K.M. Mani are not going to accept it,” Mr. Puthussery said.The move comes close on the heels of reports that the faction had already given the LDF a list of local body wards from where it wished to contest in the upcoming local body elections.Responding to the allegations levelled by the estranged leader, party general secretary Stephen George said the reasons cited by Mr. Puthussery to quit the party were nothing but the justification of a fortune seeker. “In fact, it is Mr. Puthussery, who has now taken a suicidal move as the camp he joined belonged to those who are trying to destroy the party founded by K.M. Mani,” Mr. George said.Meanwhile, Mani group leader N. Jayaraj, MLA, said the party was yet to initiate a discussion with regard to joining the LDF.

There were no plans to sell the Jaya Prakash Narayan International Centre (JPNIC), a multi-purpose convention centre dedicated to the socialist ideologue in Lucknow, an Uttar Pradesh official stated on Thursday.“No such proposal has been sent to the government,” Chief engineer of the Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) Indu Shekhar Singh told The Hindu. “We are a construction agency. This is a government project. How can we pass a proposal to sell it,” the official asked.Mr. Singh’s clarification came after a controversy was triggered over a report that the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government was planning to sell off the JPNIC to private firms for a slated price of over ₹1,642 crore. The JPNIC, an interpretation centre envisaged along the likes of the India Habit Centre of New Delhi, was conceived by the previous Samajwadi Party government, under Akhilesh Yadav. Once complete, the almost 19-acre project near the Gomti River would boast a number of facilities ranging from a world-class convention halls, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a multi-sports block, a luxury hotel, an auditorium, a business centre, a helipad and a museum. Dedicated to the personal and political journey of J.P. Narayan and through it the nascent years of Indian democracy, the museum, called the Museum of Socialism, has been operative since late 2016. However, most of the other facilities are either incomplete or inoperative. After coming to power in 2017, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government had initiated a probe into its construction. SP president Akhilesh Yadav claimed that by selling the JPNIC to “private hands” the BJP government would finish off the “prime objective” of the centre that was dedicated to socialist values.“Bent on selling off every institution and resources across the country and in the State, the BJP has sold out to the rich,” Mr. Yadav tweeted on Wednesday.The LDA official, however, said the Authority had no such plans and rejected reports that it had sent a proposal to the government. “Absolutely no, in strong words,” Mr Singh said.He added that the LDA had in fact sought additional funds of ₹110-115 crore for completing the unfinished sections of the project. Around ₹865 crore was originally sanctioned for the project.“A revised DPR (detailed project report) was sent saying that the said extra amount was required to make the projects functional,” the official said.

New caution boards have come up on either side of Mayor Muthu Road Over Bridge (ROB) warning heavy vehicles with more than 10 tonnes of weight to avoid the structure connecting Periyar bus stand with southern parts of Madurai city.Reason: the bridge has lost its designed stability due to lack of proper maintenance. The bridge is a vital connectivity on the all-important Tirupparankundram Road providing the shortest link for southern districts to Madurai railway junction and Meenakshi temple.In a bid to safeguard the “weak structure”, the Highways Department has put up another caution board restricting the speed limit on the bridge to 30 kmph.A cursory glance shows that the sub-structure of the bridge is in bad shape what with the outer plastering worn out in every pillar. The iron rods have remained exposed to open air in too many spots for very long and are rusted. Even as the plastering has peeled off in many spots for more than half-a-foot, fresh cracks on the pillars reveal the stress the substructure is undergoing.Every hour, hundreds of heavy vehicles, including buses, light vehicles and two-wheelers use the bridge under which Madurai-Manamadurai railway track runs.“The bridge is more than 45 years old and needs urgent attention to retore it to its normal health,” says former Chief Engineer, State Highways Department, A.K. Rajaduraivelpandian. It is not an isolated case of Mayor Muthu Bridge alone, but many structures of its age in the State are facing the same problem, he points out. “These are vey old bridges and routine maintenance like plastering and colour washing will not serve the purpose.” The bridges should get special attention. “Advanced scientific solutions are available and concrete mix should be injected with advanced machineries to restore their stability,” Mr. Pandian says. He recalls that he drew the attention of the State government several years ago to the need for special maintenance of bridges. However, that did not get any positive response till date. “Spending a few crores on maintenance will increase the longevity of the bridge by at least 10 to 20 years.” If not attended to immediately or not done in the proper manner, the bridge might need total replacement. The State Highways should create a separate wing for maintenance of bridges on the lines of railways.“There is a telling difference in the maintenance of the railway portion of the bridges and the approach roads [maintained by the State Highways],” he adds. A senior Highways official says a proposal for major maintenance work at a cost of ₹5 crore is pending with the State government. “The work will be taken up as per the advice of IIT-Madras. Once the reinforcement is done, it will gain its old stability.”Traffic police have been advised to divert heavy vehicles through Ellis Nagar ROB, he adds.

The National Domestic Workers Movement on Thursday called for special legislation to protect the welfare and livelihoods of the work force across the country. Addressing mediapersons, along with a group of domestic workers, P. Clara, State coordinator, emphasised their plight in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and said the movement held protests across the country on Thursday. Many workers lost their livelihoods since the outbreak of the pandemic, as they were falsely perceived to be carriers of the viral infection, said Ms. Clara. “Many of the domestic workers are sole breadwinners of their families. With the loss of livelihood, many are unable to pay their rent or make ends meet. Only a few have resumed work.” Hence, the government must provide a financial aid of ₹7,500 for each month from April to December to withstand the financial crisis caused by the pandemic.Condemning the passage of three key labour bills in Parliament, she said they would undermine the security and livelihood of unorganised workers. “The government must ensure that social security schemes can be availed by domestic workers too.”

The residence of the former Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi was a deserted place on Thursday. The house on Sampige Road in Sadashiv Nagar in Belagavi, that was otherwise full of visitors, was empty except for some family members and police personnel on guard. The family matriarch, Somavva, was in a state of shock and disbelief at the passing of her son. She kept saying that her son had told her that he will return from New Delhi after the Parliamentary session. “He told me he was going to Delhi to bring money for the development of Belagavi,” she said. She broke down while watching the final rites of Angadi on a relative’s mobile phone.KLE Chairman and Angadi’s friend Prabhakar Kore came to visit and console the grieving relatives. He told Somavva that it was God’s will and everyone had to accept it. Mr. Kore told journalists that doctors in Delhi had told him that Angadi’s health had deteriorated after he developed a block in his heart on Tuesday. He was shifted to the intensive care unit. “I had expected him to be back in a few days. But sadly,that did not happen,” he said. He said that he had advised Angadi to reduce travelling and use masks during public meetings. But he kept telling me that he was healthy and that nothing would happen to him, Mr. Kore said. C.C. Angadi, Angadi’s elder brother, regretted that most of the family members were unable to travel to Delhi due to COVID-19 restrictions. “We wanted to conduct the burial in the Somavva Angadi college in our native village of KK Koppa. But it was not possible due to the SOPs in place. We are watching the telecast of the burial,” he said. Veeranagouda Inamati, a family friend, told journalists that Bruno, Angadi’s pet dog, had sensed his absence and had stopped eating since Wednesday. Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar and around 20 other relatives and party leaders were present at the Lingayat burial ground in Delhi where Angadi’s final rites were conducted, said BJP leader Raju Chikkanagoudar, who attended the event.

The CBI searched the premises of half a dozen former officials of KITCO and that of an outreach wing of an institution on Thursday in connection with the probe into the alleged misappropriation of the agency's CSR funds and a few other contracts involving the agency. The raids were conducted in Kochi and Kottayam and on the premises of former senior officials of KITCO which is headquartered in Kochi. This was in connection with the probe into instances of alleged misappropriation of CSR funds which, according to the case, either did not reach the intended beneficiaries or did not serve the purpose for which the money was meant for. Former MD of the agency Cyriac Davis is arraigned as first accused, said a CBI official who was part of the search team. Both the Central and State governments have stake in the consultancy agency. Among the alleged cases of fund misappropriation was one in which the agency engaged an outreach wing of an institution to train women in the Kuttampuzha tribal belt in bee keeping and making value-added products from bamboo reeds. An official, who was associated with the implementation of the initiative and had been questioned by the CBI earlier, said that the project to handhold a few dozen women was implemented in 2015. The local body too was involved in the project, he said. The project ran into controversy after Forest Department officials, under whose area it was implemented, feigned ignorance of the initiative. An RTI activist had alleged that KITCO officials misappropriated the bulk of funds which were meant to empower tribal women. A probe is also under way into the alleged irregularities in identifying KITCO's head office and alleged erroneous design of an effluent treatment plant at Cochin SEZ, which led to leakage, necessitating intervention of the State Pollution Control Board. Mr. Davis was unavailable for comment. A VACB probe had revealed that the agency’s slack supervision led to cracks surfacing on Palarivattom flyover within two years of its commissioning, following which a senior official was remanded.

Telangana High Court on Thursday directed the State government to conduct re-postmortem examination of the bodies of three persons, allegedly Maoists, who were killed in an exchange of fire with the police in Bhadradri Kothagudem district. Hearing a PIL petition which was moved as lunch motion, a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice B. Vijaysen Reddy said photographs and videographs of the second PME should be taken and presented before it. On completion of the second autopsy, the bodies should be handed over to their respective family members, the bench said. It said a team of forensic doctors from MGM hospital in Warangal should be constituted to conduct the autopsy of three bodies. The PIL plea was filed by Civil Liberties Committee Telangana State president professor Gaddam Laxman seeking to declare the ‘alleged encounter’ in Bhadrachalam Agency area, in which two women and a man were killed, as illegal. A murder case should have been registered against the police personnel responsible for the killing of three persons. Not registering the case under section 302 of Indian Penal Code should also be declared as illegal, the petitioner said. Lawyer V. Raghunath, appearing for the petitioner, said police killed the three persons and were trying to hastily hand over the bodies to the family members to wipe out crucial evidence in the case. He contended that identity of the ‘murdered persons’ was yet to be established. Advocate General B.S. Prasad informed the court that the three Maoists were already identified as Sodi Jogaiah, Madakam Mangi and Madakam Malli. PME of the bodies was already completed. The PME was video recorded and the bodies were handed over to the respective family members, the AG said. Mr. Raghunath contended that there was every possibility of police screening the evidence and insisted for second autopsy. The bench directed the government to recover the bodies from the families and preserve them in Bhadrachalam area hospital. The team of forensic doctors from MGM hospital would perform the second autopsy. The petition would be heard again on November 5.

The Special Court of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) will pronounce on Friday its judgement in the case of Subhani Haja joining the IS.The NIA argued that members of the IS hatched a criminal conspiracy to spread the activities of the organisation and to wage a war against India by collecting explosives besides waging war against Iraq, an Asiatic power, which is in alliance with India.It had invoked Section 125 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a rarely invoked section which deals with waging war against an Asiatic country, against the accused. P. Krishnakumar, the NIA Special Judge, will deliver the judgement at 11 a.m.The NIA contended that Haja joined the ISIS between April and September 2015 and waged war against the government of Iraq. He was trained by ISIS in Mosul in Iraq in combat and warfare and deployed in the war front of Iraq. On returning to India, he tried to procure explosives and chemicals from Sivakasi to wage a war against India, the NIA submitted.It said a forensic medical examination on Haja revealed that he had a radio-opaque material embedded in his leg, which could have been acquired from the war zone. Residues of explosives such as potassium nitrate and potassium chlorate were found on his jackets, indicating that he was in the war zone of Iraq and Syria.Haja was arrested by the agency on October 5, 2016.Opposing the arguments of the NIA, V.T. Raghunath, the counsel for the accused, contended that the case was a fabricated one and there were no direct evidences to prove that Haja had waged war against Iraq and conspired to wage war against India.The NIA built up its case that Haja conspired to wage war against India by banking on some chats he allegedly made through a social media platform. Regarding the allegation of attempts to purchase explosives from Sivakasi, all that the NIA could gather was some oral evidences. The evidences produced by the NIA were unreliable ones, he contended.

The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Thursday sought time before the Bombay High Court to reply to bail pleas filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik in connection with a drug case after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh, representing the NCB, told a single Bench of justice SV Kotwal that he had not received a copy of the bail applications and that he needed time to file a reply.To which, advocate Satish Maneshinde, for the Chakrabortys, said he had served a copy twice to the NCB and that he could also serve it to the ASG directly. He also questioned the jurisdiction of the agency to probe the matter as the Supreme Court had ruled on August 19 that all investigation in Sushant’s death case have to be transferred to the CBI.Mr. Maneshinde started arguing that sections under which Ms. Chakraborty had been charged were bailable and section 27A (punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) of the Narcotics Drugs Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act applied was not applicable. The embargo on bail under section 37 of the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act applied to commercial quantities only and the offences in relation to Ms. Chakraborty, at worst, were of small quantity.

Social Democratic Party of India cadre staged a demonstration in front of Passport Seva Kendra on South Bypass Road here on Thursday in protest against the recently passed Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020.Tearing copies of the Bill, they raised slogans against the Centre, saying agriculture, already hit hard by the ‘pro-rich economic policies’ of the Union government, would be wiped out. So the Bill should be withdrawn forthwith.SDPI’s Tirunelveli district Farmers’ wing president Maanur Shaikh Abdullah said the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union government had cleared three Bills with an eye on helping the corporate firms instead of reviving the farming sector despite stiff opposition by the Opposition parties. The Bills would be a boon to the rich, who could hoard essential commodities such as food grains, oil, onion, potato, oil seeds, dhal etc., though Food Corporation of India could not procure them from the producers by offering minimum support price.Mr. Abdullah also criticised the the ruling AIADMK in the State for supporting the Bill.Similar demonstration was organised in Thoothukudi while Congress protested at Chidambara Nagar.

In a first of its kind initiative in the country, gram panchayats under the Pune Zilla Parishad have pooled underutilised health fund money to purchase 92 ambulances and firm up the rural health infrastructure amid the rise in COVID-19 cases.Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad, said this is probably the first instance where the rural administration of a district has taken the lead in buying ambulances since such purchases usually fall under the domain of the State government.A sarpanch of a gram panchayat told The Hindu, “Under the 14th and 15th Finance Commissions, a portion of funds allotted to gram panchayats under the rubric of ‘health’ was lying unutilised. Often, the gram panchayats don’t know where to use their ‘health’ money and generally expend them in local-level sanitary works like repairing drainage systems.”Mr. Prasad, in an innovative move, directed purchases of ambulances to be made under Section 139 of the Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959. “The gram panchayats passed resolutions and then pooled in their money, with each contributing their share as a proportion of their population. After obtaining a ‘technical’ sanction from the State government, we went ahead with the purchases, which were made over the one-stop Government e-Marketplace hosted by the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposals, where common user goods and services can be procured,” he said.Each ambulance, a TATA Winger van purchased at ₹14.22 lakh, is equipped with two portable oxygen cylinders of 2.2 litre capacity, Global Positioning System, auto-loading stretcher facility and storage space for first aid and nursing kits. The driver’s remuneration and the cost of fuel are to be borne by the Zilla Parishad from its cess funds, authorities said.Mr. Prasad said, “At present, 51 of these ambulances have been purchased. The remaining 41 will be procured next week. Of the 82 ambulances purchased by the State government, 41 were designated for rural areas. However, only 28 of these were equipped to ferry COVID-19 patients. The addition of 92 ambulances will be a tremendous boost to the healthcare system in rural parts.” The move is expected to significantly firm up the healthcare infrastructure in Pune Rural, which has witnessed a dramatic surge in cases in the past three weeks. With an average daily case surge of nearly 1,000, the region has reported around 15,000 active cases and more than 1,200 deaths. “Many a time, patients in far-flung areas lack easy access to multi-specialty hospitals. Moreover, ambulances are not fully equipped to cater to the urgent needs of critical patients. We hope to eliminate these problems with this new fleet of ambulances,” said Mr. Prasad. Pune Zilla Parishad authorities said once the COVID-19 cases dwindle, the vehicles would be converted into 102 ambulances in a permanent augmentation of the Pune’s rural healthcare infrastructure This isn’t the first time that the Pune Zilla Parishad has come up with a novel solution amid the COVID-19 crisis. In April, it came up with another out-of-the-box solution: placing errant spouses in institutional quarantine to counter rising cases of domestic violence during the lockdown.

CPI(M) MP K.K. Ragesh in an open letter to Deputy Chairman Harivansh questioned the motive behind allegedly throwing off all rules and Parliamentary procedures aside to ignore the demands for a vote by him and others during the passage of the two farm Bills. He accused Mr. Harivansh of doing so to appease Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr. Ragesh along with seven other Opposition MPs were suspended for the pandemonium on Sunday, when the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 were cleared by the Rajya Sabha. The Opposition had then moved a no-confidence motion against Mr. Harivansh, which was rejected by Chairman Venkaiah Naidu. “It comes as a surprise that a person like you, who claims to be a Socialist, could take a hypocritical position, by totally neglecting the real incidents, towards embracing political equities! As you may be well aware, what happened in the House on 20th September 2020 was the blatant refusal of my right as a Member of Parliament,” Mr. Ragesh wrote. He claims that the statutory resolution rejecting the two Bills moved by him was not voted upon, despite his repeated demands calling for a division. He also said the Deputy Chairman’s “stubborn attitude” resulted in the blow up. He also accused Mr. Harivansh of acting at the behest of the treasury benches. Mr. Ragesh asked, “Was your decision to allow passing of the Bills amid such a strong protest from members, by maintaining utter disregard to the rules and procedures, was to appease the Prime Minister as well as to get into his good books?” He also noted in his letter that despite repeated demands the microphones of the Opposition members were not switched on. He also accused Mr. Harivansh of using the physical distancing norms to ram through the legislation. “On what grounds did you charge a member that he did not request for the Chair’s permission by remaining in the seat ‘allotted to him’? Are members given specific seats in this session? Due to obvious reasons of COVID-19 norms of social distancing, MPs are even made to sit in the Lok Sabha Chamber,” Mr. Ragesh wrote.

Bengaluru lad K.L. Rahul showed little concern for allegiance to home, dismantling Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) with a sparkling unbeaten century for Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday. Rahul’s 69-ball 132, laced with 14 fours and seven sixes, propelled KXIP to a comfortable 97-run victory.KXIP amassed 206 for three in 20 overs before skittling out RCB for 109 in 17 overs.Rahul, a former RCB player, was in full flow while recording his second IPL century. He got going with two crisp square-cuts off Dale Steyn, which pierced the tight off-side field. Umesh Yadav was not spared either, with Rahul launching into the fast bowler in the 10th over. Yuzvendra Chahal was the pick of the bowlers once again, but when the leg-spinner strayed on the pads, Rahul unleashed the sweep to good effect. The 28-year-old cut loose in the last three overs, smashing five sixes and three fours.Quite uncharacteristically, RCB skipper Virat Kohli dropped two sitters in the deep. Rahul, the beneficiary on both occasions, could hardly believe his luck. The KXIP skipper ended up scoring more than half of his team’s total.The RCB pacers, meanwhile, made life easy for KXIP. Umesh sprayed it down the leg much too often, while Steyn bowled too short and wide. Even Navdeep Saini, the team’s standout pacer, could not maintain a good length and was punished.The slide beginsRCB’s troubles continued in a poor chase. The side lost three wickets in the first three overs, including that of key man Kohli. Opener Devdutt Padikkal, who had shown much promise in the previous match, was cramped for room by left-arm seamer Sheldon Cottrell. The lefthander’s awkward pull sliced to Ravi Bishnoi at mid-on. Young Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Josh Philippe was trapped on the pads by Mohammed Shami for a duck.The wicket of Kohli (1, 5b), who was dismissed in similar fashion to Padikkal, spelt big trouble for RCB. Not enoughAaron Finch (20, 21b) and A.B. de Villiers (28, 18b) tried to repair the damage, but their 49-run stand was grossly inadequate. The rest of the contest drudged along without much purpose, as RCB was well and truly out of it.Leggies Bishnoi and M. Ashwin picked up three wickets each for KXIP. The Punjab side notched up its first win in two matches, while the Bengaluru outfit was humbled after a sparkling start to its campaign a few days earlier.ScoreboardKINGS XI PUNJAB: K.L.

TIRUCHI: The City Police have deployed a team inside the Gandhi Market here to carry out patrolling inside and outside the premises. The market has remained shut in the wake of the lockdown imposed due to the spread of COVID-19. Police sources said a team of four police personnel have been deployed in shifts round-the-clock for patrolling inside and outside the market which has several shops and outlets inside. The police personnel have been provided with walkie-talkie sets for communication.The move follows three fire accidents reported inside the market during the lockdown that triggered anxiety among traders, say police sources. There were also complaints of some thefts having taken place inside the market, which has six gates, prompting the deployment of a team round-the-clock as a precautionary measure, the sources further said. The traders have been seeking the re-opening of the market which has remained shut since late March due to the pandemic.

The terms laid down in a new global tender floated by Coal India for the empanelment of coal-inspection companies has practically rendered nearly all indigenous inspection firms ineligible to participate. The tender closes on October 1.Inspection companies carry out lab tests of coal and other minerals to evaluate their quality. Several Indian companies are in this business for decades, a few even a century old, and they have had a presence in the market in spite of the volume of their business not matching that of multinationals that have set shop in India in the recent years.The tender was floated on August 17, shortly after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon Indians to be atma nirbhar, or self-reliant. As per its original requirements, only companies with a working capital of ₹20 crore, a turnover of ₹100 crore in the last three years, and who have executed jobs worth ₹50 crore in the coal sector in any of the last three financial years, were eligible to apply.The aggrieved companies then formed a group, the Association of Bharatiya Inspection Agencies, and wrote a letter to Coal India with copies to the Prime Minister and senior officials, saying relaxations in the eligibility would not only give a business opportunity to some of the oldest India-origin inspection companies but also be reflective of Mr. Modi’s atma nirbhar policy.Subsequently, according to sources, the ₹50-crore lower limit for coal-related jobs in any of the last three financial years was brought down to ₹30 crore and the turnover requirement was revised to ₹50 crore, but that still leaves most of the indigenous inspection companies out of the race.Traditionally, Coal India has always assigned the lab testing of samples to the Central Institute of Mining and Fuel Research, which in turn hired testing companies. But this year, it decided to float a global tender, which gives an outright edge to global companies that come under the umbrella of the International Federation of Inspection Agencies, headquartered in London.“The tender has been designed to benefit global companies. Why should I have a working capital of ₹20 crore? I am only testing coal, not buying coal. Why should I have a turnover of ₹50 crore in three years — the volume of business needs to be really, really massive in order to achieve that turnover. This will ultimately lead to the death of many Indian companies, which have been in the business for 60 to 100 years and employ hundreds of people,” said a member of the Association of Bharatiya Inspection Agencies, who did not want to be named.A senior Coal India official, on the condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that the idea behind a global tender was to make the system transparent and to “sterilise” it. “We are certainly not against Indian companies, only that we want the best, because the mining sector is going to witness a lot of changes in the coming months,” the official said.

 Audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) found that the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) had failed in its objective to avoid haphazard development and the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had failed to levy penalties for delayed projects. The report also found that the Government of India Presses were owed ₹94.74 crore in printing charges over a period of 41 years. The audit reports, which were tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, found irregularities in payments by the departments and agencies of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry. Also read | Work on 20-year regional plan for NCR beginsIn its compliance audit for 2018-2019, the CAG said the CPWD had failed to levy departmental charges for construction of the National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) building in Kolkata, resulting in a revenue loss of ₹58.10 lakh. The CPWD in its reply in August 2018 said the NSIC was fully government-owned, so the departmental charges were not included in the preliminary estimates. “The reply of the CPWD is not acceptable because NSIC is a commercial enterprise undertaking commercial activities. Hence, departmental charges should have been recovered from the NSIC,” the CAG report said, adding that the Ministry was yet to reply as of May 2020. In its audit report for 2017-2018 on various ministries and autonomous bodies, which had a total of 24 paragraphs, the CAG said the Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry was yet to respond to seven of the 12 audit paras related to it. The report said the NCRPB’s objectives were “coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the RP [regional plan]; and evolving harmonised policies for control of land uses and developing infrastructure in the region so as to avoid any haphazard development of the region.” “Audit noticed that the Board was unable to accomplish either of the two objectives.” On the CPWD, the report mentioned certain “deficiencies” regarding the construction of Lok Sabha staff and officers’ residential quarters in R.K. Puram in Delhi. “CPWD accorded various extensions to the work without taking any concrete action to recover penalty despite a delay of more than 29 months in execution of the work. Delay of a substantial part of time was caused due to lapses on the part of CPWD also,” it said. Regarding the Directorate of Printing and the Government of India Presses that it operates, the report found: “Due to lack of effective monitoring mechanism for recovery of dues, the Directorate of Printing could not recover printing charges which had accumulated to the extent of ₹94.74 crore as on March 31, 2018 and were outstanding for a period up to 41 years.”

 Thai lawmakers met Thursday to vote on six proposed amendments to the country’s military-backed constitution, as protesters pushing for charter reform gathered outside the Parliament building. Changes to the constitution are one of three core demands that a coalition of protest groups has been seeking in recent months. The groups, which on Sunday held one of the biggest protest rallies in years, also want new elections and an end to intimidation of political activists, saying they are needed to strengthen democracy. The protests, spearheaded by students, come as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s government faces broader criticism that it is ineffective and without direction as the economy sputters due to the knock-on effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The government is also under pressure from some influential Thai royalists chagrined that the protesters are seeking unprecedented reforms to the monarchy, a sacrosanct institution to conservatives. The current charter was written under the auspices of the military junta that took power after a 2014 coup and pushed it through in a referendum in which campaigning for a no vote was illegal. Prayuth led that coup, headed the military government and was named prime minister again after last year’s general election, held under the rules laid out by the new charter. The constitution’s critics say its main aim was to secure the grip on power of the country’s traditional ruling elite - royalists, unelected bureaucrats and the military - by breaking that of political parties. The constitution does not come from the people 100%, said Kanyakorn Suntornprug, a 20-year-old rallying outside Parliament. Even if in the past, it was not 100% democratic but at least there was some participation from the people.  The two-day debate on the amendments, which started Wednesday, is seen largely as an attempt to placate the protesters and ease pressure on the government. Voting by both houses of Parliament was expected to be completed late in the night. While there is growing agreement that changes to the constitution are needed, there’s wide divergence over what those changes should be. Key sections in dispute include the position and privileges of the monarchy - which protesters want to see redefined - and the role and powers of the unelected Senate.The Senate’s 250 appointed members are seen as unequivocal backers of the present government and greatly influenced by the military. Most controversially, they are allowed to vote in the selection of a prime minister, a provision critics slam as fundamentally anti-democratic. There are six proposals for charter amendment: one from Prime Minister Prayuth’s governing coalition and five from the opposition. The one point both sides support is amending Section 256, which would establish a Constitution Drafting Assembly to write a new charter from scratch. The process could take as long as two years to complete. However, it is unclear if enough senators would support the measure for it to pass, because voting on the amendments is conducted by a joint sitting of both houses. For any motion to pass it will need the support of at least a third of the senators, making victory uncertain even for the government’s draft supporting revision of Section 256. Thailand, which has seen more than a dozen coups, has had 20 constitutions since the end of direct rule by kings in 1932.

 Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has come out with detailed guidelines for investment advisors asking them to ensure segregation of advisory and distribution activities at the client level. Besides, SEBI has fixed a cap on fee that investment advisors (IA) can charge from clients. It has also put in place a procedural framework pertaining to audit and record-keeping. Under the rules, an individual IA will apply for registration as non-individual investment advisor on onboarding 150 clients and IA will have to enter into an investment advisory agreement with its clients.Also read | SEBI makes raising funds easier for stressed companies In a circular on Wednesday, the regulator said investment advisors will have to ensure compliance with regard to client-level segregation of advisory and distribution activities. To ensure client-level segregation at the IA’s group level, SEBI said existing clients who wish to take advisory services will not be eligible for availing distribution services within the group/family of IA, and vice-versa for those availing advisory services. It further said a new client will be eligible to avail either advisory or distribution services within the group or family of the investment advisors and this option needs to be made available at the time of boarding. “IA shall enter into investment advisory agreement with its clients including existing clients latest by April 1, 2021, and submit a report, confirming the same to SEBI latest by June 30, 2021,” the regulator noted. With regard to fees, SEBI said IAs will charge fees from the clients in either of the two modes – Assets Under Advice (AUA) and fixed fee. Under the AUA mode, the maximum fees that may be charged will not exceed 2.5% of AUA per annum per client across all services offered by the IA.Sebi extends timeline for implementation of procedural guidelines for proxy advisors to Jan 1 In case of the fixed fee mode, maximum fees that may be charged will not exceed ₹1.25 lakh per annum per client across all services. The IA will charge fees from a client under any one mode on an annual basis and the change of mode will be effected only after 12 months of on-boarding. If agreed by the client, IA may charge fees in advance. However, such advance will not exceed fees for two quarters, the regulator said. With regard to qualification, SEBI said existing individual IAs above 50 years of age as on September 30, 2020, will not be required to comply with the qualification and experience requirements. However, such IAs will require to hold NISM-accredited certification. As per the norms, IA must have a post-graduate degree in specific subjects and five years of work experience related to advice in financial products or securities or portfolio management. An employee associated with investment advice also needs to have such a post-graduate degree and two years of experience. On registration as non-individual investment advisor, SEBI said an individual IA can apply for registration as non-individual investment advisor on or before reaching 150 clients. Once number of clients reaches 150 and till grant of registration as a non-individual IA, SEBI said individual IA will not on-board fresh clients. However, during the period of examination of application by SEBI, individual IA will continue to service existing clients. In case the IA does not get registration, such IA will continue the advisory activities. “Existing individual IA having more than 150 clients as on September 30, 2020 shall not on-board fresh clients and such Individual IA shall apply for registration as non-individual IA latest by April 1, 2021,” the regulator noted. The IA will have to maintain records of interactions with all clients, including prospective clients (prior to on-boarding), where any conversation related to advice has taken place in the form of SMS or telephonic conversation, among others. Such records will begin with first interaction with the client and will continue till the completion of advisory services to the client. They need to maintain these records for a period of five years. However, in case where a dispute has been raised, such records will be kept till its resolution or if SEBI desires that specific records be preserved, then such records will be kept till further intimation from the regulator. The deadline for compliance for these guidelines ranges from January 1, 2021 to April 1, 2021, the SEBI noted. SEBI had floated a consultation paper on investment advisors in January and after considering the inputs from public notified the norms in this regard in July and these amended norms will come into force on September 30.

 With the water level in the Idukki reservoir nearing the blue alert level on Thursday, a control room has been opened and arrangements made to monitor the situation.Though rain has subsided, the inflow remained high with the water level in the dam reaching 2,387.04 ft. The blue alert level is 2,387.79 ft.Though the present water level was below the rule curve level (2,395.79 ft) fixed by the Central Water Commission, the rise in the water level was attributed to the heavy rainfall two days back and low generation at the Moolamattom power house.Usually, the generation level is lowered during the monsoon season.According to the Dam Monitoring and Research Station at Vazhathoppe, the generation level was nearly 4.5 mu for the past three days. Though the water level is nearly 7 ft short of the red alert level, an official at the research station said the chances of opening the shutters of the reservoir were remote. The situation would change in the event of a heavy rainfall and power generation had to be raised to control the water level.In case of an increase in water level, an orange alert will be sounded at 2,393.78 ft before the red alert at 2,394.79 ft. The full reservoir level is 2,404 ft.Supriya S., KSEB chief engineer (Dam Safety and DRIP), on Thursday said the blue alert was marked as an internal alert system. “It is for advanced measures to be taken to prevent a sudden water release from a dam. With the rain subsiding, the inflow too will fall. The safety measures ensure the controlled release of water in case of a heavy rainfall,” she said.Though the water level in the Pampa was flowing above the blue alert level, the inflow has come down on Thursday. At Kakki, the water level was much below the rule curve level, she added.

If there is one thing that the first ever fully ‘digital’ Couture Week in India has proven, it is the fact that the role of the designer has evolved beyond the traditional expertise of many fashion designers. Their collections’ ‘narratives’—already subservient to the demands of social media—have become more important than the products they seek to sell.This feature, readers, will not give you the details of which designer showed which silhouettes, championed which crafts or embellishments, or how the models looked draped in yards of luxurious textiles. You only need to search Instagram and see that for yourselves. I simply wish to draw aside the veil between designer and consumer, created by the many demands of a digital showcase.Look beyond the storyHaute Couture as the French have called it for centuries, has over the years taken on its own definition in India. This is a country many consider the last true bastion of handmade, handcrafted luxury in the world. Our handwoven textiles and painstakingly crafted embellishments that take hundreds of hours by a single artisan, now seem to hold no inherent value on their own. All thanks to social media’s drive of democratisation and its constant craving for stories and narratives.

Now, each designer must vie for the fickle attention of a large group of viewers who may not even be able to afford their creativity and artisanship. The irony. Without a narrative attached, real customers cannot see themselves in these clothes. Think of Gaurav Gupta’s excellently inclusive choice of models, Rahul Mishra taking us to a renovated Tijara Palace, while few if us have had the privilege to travel in the past six months, Kunal Rawal using the iconic Asiatic Library in Mumbai, and Anju Modi evoking ancient Indian beauty rituals. Without these identifiers, the customer is lost. How sad.If this is the reality today, I congratulate Falguni and Shane Peacock for creating the most real and relevant digital experience among them all. They have their finger firmly on the pulse. Celebrity stylist Shaleena Nathani sashayed onto a fashion show set and fiddled with a model’s gown before sending her and others off onto the catwalk. As the video progressed, stylist Tanya Ghavri was spotted correcting a flawlessly worn dress, followed by Bollywood’s favourite stylists Aastha Sharma and Mohit Rai. This is Falguni and Shane Peacock talking directly to their fans. After all, which woman able to afford haute couture doesn’t dream of a Mohit Rai or a Shaleena Nathani fussing over her? They made their customers’ fantasies come alive, while others just tried to tell their ‘stories’ in the hopes of being understood.Even with the return of JJ Valaya to the couture showcase—a designer who had his own website way before anyone even conceived of the idea in the early 2000s—the fact that he was the only one to talk directly to his viewers was eventually subsumed. By? The simple regularity of a beautifully produced fashion show video. But no use crying over split silk.The reality is that today, few designers in India are able to synchronise their digital experience with e-commerce backup. And the very nature of e-commerce is antithetical to the tactile and sensory experience of Indian haute couture, of which consultations with the designer are an important part. So even if a designer is fully prepared to take orders online immediately after their digital showcase, it is near impossible to predict the return on their investment. This is, after all, haute couture; by definition, it is made to order in every way imaginable.

Which revisits the ‘storytelling’ aspect, and the creation of X-women and men, where X represents the designer’s name. This is a good strategy, so that clients buy haute couture without actually asking for too much customisation or face-time with the designer. First came SabyasachiI spoke to Rahul Mishra two days before his show aired on Instagram, and he pointed out that while this may be the country’s first digital haute couture fashion week, Kolkata-based designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee had already mastered the art of the Instagram reveal a number of years ago. In the process, Sabyasachi has become a one-name brand—like Madonna and Cher—for which he deserves unlimited credit. Why then are the fashion industry’s other flag-bearers not able to create their own ways of showcasing their work? Did they think an online film festival would—and here I reference a feature already published online on the Business of Fashion—be enough?I had promised my editor at this publication that I would watch all Couture Week shows on my phone screen on the official FDCI Instagram handle like thousands of ‘non-fashion industry-related’ followers, in an attempt to see it through their eyes.

After viewing all ten showcases over five evenings, I am left with a few simple questions: Is every designer good at ‘storytelling’ in the way that Instagram demands they be? Should they be? Do they need entire myths and legends to be spun around their clothes to sell them? Maybe I am too much of an idealist, but do clothes that support and supply entire factories and craft clusters of skilled artisans with livelihoods need any other validation than their inherent value?As I end this feature with these queries, I would like to assure my peers in the fashion industry that I have not written it to mock their efforts. We are all learning as we enter a new digital age and face its challenges, heightened by the global pandemic that continues to rage all around us. I am here simply as a questioner, and I know very well that there are no right answers. Only those that work for each designer personally and individually.The author is a fashion commentator and Communications Director at the House of Angadi

 Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi “God of farmers”, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said three farm sector reform bills passed recently by Parliament will double the income of cultivators. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday night, Mr. Chouhan termed those opposing the bills as “kisandrohi” (anti-farmers) and claimed they are doing so to protect the interest of middlemen.“The Prime Minister, who is taking farsighted decisions, is God of farmers. All the three bills related to agriculture reforms are a blessing for farmers. These will double their income,” Mr. Chouhan said. People opposing these bills are not well-wishers of farmers and are just misleading them, the BJP leader said.“If any exporter, by paying a good price, purchases wheat and rice from farmers directly, then there will be no need for middlemen. Why are opposition parties supporting these middlemen?” he asked. By crticising these bills, the opposition parties are not opposing the Prime Minister, but “blindly opposing” interests of farmers, the Chief Minister said. The Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 were passed in both the houses of Parliament amid protests from the opposition parties. On Wednesday, 18 opposition parties urged President Ram Nath Kovind not to sign the contentious bills and alleged that they were passed “unconstitutionally” in “complete disregard” of parliamentary norms. The Modi government has claimed these bills are to ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce without being subject to the regulations of mandis (agri markets).Farmer organisations and the opposition parties allege that the law has been framed to suit “big corporates who seek to dominate the Indian food and agriculture business”, and will weaken the negotiating power of farmers.

 Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s much-awaited promotion in the batting order will be an area of interest when Chennai Super Kings strive to pick up pieces against a confident Delhi Capitals in their third IPL encounter on September 25.The shock defeat against Rajasthan Royals on a batting belter at Sharjah could be primarily attributed to a poor show by their spinners along with a disastrous 20th over but the batsmen can’t absolve themselves completely, especially Murali Vijay, Kedar Jadhav and the skipper himself.Dhoni had come in to bat at number seven, promoting the likes of Sam Curran, Jadhav and Ruturaj Gaikwad ahead of himself but the ploy backfired badly leaving Faf du Plessis with too much work in too little time.While his fans still swear by his six-hitting ability, a closer look would show that Dhoni is unable to change the gears against express pace and it was only when Tom Curran came with his medium fast, Dhoni launched an attack. That too when the match as a contest was over.However on a big Dubai ground with bigger-sized boundaries, the skipper can rotate the strike better unlike Sharjah and also take those extra deliveries to settle down.For Delhi Capitals, winning a cliffhanger right at the onset would have given them a lot of confidence even though Ravichandran Ashwin’s probable absence after a shoulder injury could force them to reshuffle their bowling line-up.“We will take a call on Ashwin after today’s practice session. He is coming for training. Our physio Patrick Farhart will take a final call,” DC fielding coach Mohammed Kaif said in a pre-match presser.Senior spinner Amit Mishra could be an option to partner Axar Patel in case Ashwin is unable to make it.“It’s a good thing that we have a ready replacement like Amit Mishra, who has a lot of experience,” Kaif said about IPL’s second highest wicket-taker.The cushion of bigger boundaries can always help a wrist spinner attack more by tossing the ball up.Another aspect will be pacer Mohit Sharma’s performance. While Mohit got K.L. Rahul at the beginning but his loose deliveries at the back-end made things difficult for the Capitals even as Kagiso Rabada bowled tightly at one end.Against a side like CSK which revels in attacking the last 10 overs, the Capitals might like to try Harshal Patel, who is also a handy batsman at any number having opened in domestic cricket.This is if Ishant Sharma, who is still nursing an ankle injury is available.“Ishant had a good run yesterday but didn’t bowl. He will be again training today and then we will take a call,” said Kaif.Anrich Nortje in his first IPL game wasn’t bad but left-armer Daniel Sams could create those awkward angles that batsmen dislike.Shimron Hetmyer is likely to get one more chance unless Ricky Ponting wants to bring in some stability in the form of Alex Carey.Talking of big hitters, Delhi has one too many in their line-up including Prithvi Shaw, Shikhar Dhawan, Rishabh Pant, skipper Shreyas Iyer and last match’s hero Marcus Stoinis, who would like to throw up an open challenge for Piyush Chawla and Ravindra Jadeja, who had a forgettable last outing.

 The owners of the Greek-owned oil tanker that caught fire off Sri Lanka’s eastern coast have agreed to settle the claim of $1.8 million, officials said on Thursday. They agreed to pay the amount a week after Sri Lanka’s Attorney General Dappula de Livera staked a claim of $1.8 million for the costs incurred on dousing the fire on board the Panama-registered tanker MT New Diamond on September 3.Rajapaksa thanks defence personnel for fighting fire onboard MT New Diamond New Diamond, a vessel under charter by the Indian Oil Corporation, was carrying 2,70,000 metric tonnes of crude oil from Mina Al Ahmadi port in Kuwait to the Indian port of Paradip when a boiler explosion in its engine room caused a fire off the coast of Sangamankanda in Ampara district. A Filipino crew member died and another was injured in the incident. The Sri Lanka Navy with the help of Indian counterparts and coast guard doused the fire after great effort.Sri Lankan navy plugs fuel leak on oil tanker The New Diamond’s owners have told the Attorney General of their willingness to meet the interim claim. The Attorney General had ordered the police to record a statement from the captain of the ship. The Colombo chief magistrate court later ordered the captain of the oil tanker to appear before the court on September 28. He was to be charged for committing offences under the Marine Pollution Environmental Protection Act. The ship is currently in the seas 70 nautical miles east of Batticaloa in the east and 129 kilometres away from the Batticaloa coast. Two Sri Lankan Naval ships, one Indian Naval ship and three Indian coast guard vessels are currently deployed in the operations near the oil tanker. Some five ships of Indian coast guard and one Indian Navy ship engaged in fire-fighting, the Sri Lanka Navy said early this month. The tanker had 23 crew members - 18 Filipinos and five Greeks. Twenty-two of the 23-member crew had been safely rescued off the tanker.

Initial symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease happening due to the damaging of tissues that can lead to shortening of breath, have been noticed in a couple of people who recovered from COVID-19 here recently.This was revealed by M. Shamsudeen, consultant physician attached to a Post-COVID Care Clinic at IQRAA Hospital in Kozhikode. The clinic has been set up jointly by the National Health Mission, Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, and the State government. The out-patient section here is open all days except Sunday from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.“The symptoms were found in two persons who came here for post-COVID check-up. One was in his 40s and the other in his 50s. Without losing time, they were given treatment. If they were late, it would have been difficult,” Dr. Shamsudeen said. He pointed out that fatigue, headache, body pain, breathlessness, and cough are some of the common after-effects found among those who had approached the clinic after recovering from COVID-19. According to experts, almost 20% of people who got cured of the infection may develop future health problems. This includes asymptomatic people who were tested positive for the virus. It has been termed ‘post-COVID syndrome’ or ‘long COVID’. Paralysis, cardiac arrest, and epilepsy could be some of the consequences. Doctors at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences had earlier said that a majority of these patients might have conditions caused by other diseases. At least some of them may have to go for lung transplants, they had said. Developed countries such as the United Kingdom has already begun ‘post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study’. It is a consortium of researches and clinicians from across that country “to understand and improve long-term health outcomes for patients who have been in hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.” In India, Delhi government is reported to have launched similar efforts.Dr. Shamsudeen, however, noted that not many are aware of the importance of post-COVID care. “Those who have cough or breathing problems need to immediately seek medical treatment. Any negligence can be fatal,” he said. The clinic has three physicians and one pulmonologist.

A Class 8 student, Ishita Achar, is thrilled to have received a letter from Defence Minister Rajnath Singh for the 300 two-layered cotton face masks she sent to Indian Army personnel a month ago by parcel.“Initially, there was no acknowledgement from the Ministry. I thought that they were among the hundreds they receive. But, today, we received a personal letter from the Defence Minister appreciating my work,” said an excited Ishita Achar, a student of Madhava Kripa School of Udupi. In the letter of September 16 addressed to Ishita Achar’s mother Nandita Achar, Mr. Rajnath Singh has said, “Thank you for preparing face masks for our Army personnel. I appreciate the sentiments of your daughter Ishita Achar towards our Jawans and her awareness of the safety measures during the COVID-19. I wish your daughter all the best for her future endeavours.”Ishita Achar prepared these masks as part of a drive initiated by State Commissioner for Bharat Scouts and Guides and former Minister P.G.R. Sindhia asking Scouts and Guides to prepare face masks for Class 10 students writing the SSLC examination. “As there was enough stock of masks for Class 10 students, a family friend suggested sending the masks to the jawans,” Ishita Achar said.As it was the first time that Ishita Achar was trying her hand at sewing, Ms. Nandita Achar, a home-maker, helped her daughter initially. “After mastering the skill, Ishita Achar stitched the masks for the Army personnel on her own,” Ms. Nandita Achar said.

Following complaints of encroachments in Kanirowther Lake, the district administration has decided to survey the water body on October 1. Members of Kanirowther Lake Retrieval Movement were claiming that the 40-acre lake was reduced to 14.40 acre due to construction of a four-storeyed commercial building while the inlet waterway was closed by encroachers. They said that the Collector and the District Revenue Officer had many years ago ordered demolition of the unauthorised structure. But the corporation, instead of demolishing the structure, is constructing a pathway and a boundary wall to protect the encroachers. Recently, they staged a protest in the lake and decided to begin indefinite protest from September 24. On Wednesday, Erode Revenue Divisional Officer C. Saibudeen held talks with the members who put forth their demands. After discussions, it was decided to survey the lake at 10 a.m. on October 1 until which no protest should be held. It was also decided that the civic body should not carry out any construction activities in the lake till survey is done. The meeting was attended by senior police officials and corporation officials.

Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation’s new tourist attraction that faced hurdles over COVID-19 situation early this year is gearing up for a launch in Mysuru and Hampi, the State’s two major tourist destinations.‘Ambari’, a specially-built double-decker bus for open-roof bus tours, is being launched in Mysuru during the low-key Dasara celebrations. The initiative's launch planned in March this year was put off in view of the pandemic.With the festivities approaching, the KSTDC is now making preparations for rolling out the open-roof bus tours and ferrying tourists on the designated route to help them experience the beauty of Mysuru’s rich heritage on the go.The KSTDC had requested the Forest Department and the Mysuru City Corporation to prune tree branches on the designated route for the smooth movement of the 16-ft.-tall bus.The Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation was also requested to raise its overhead electrical lines to facilitate hassle-free movement of the bus, and these works are expected to be done by Dasara. The 40-seater bus, with lower and upper decks, was built in Bengaluru.KSTDC Regional Manager Uday Kumar told The Hindu that the CESC is expected to commence the work soon while the MCC and the Forest Department are already on the job. “All of them have assured us to get the things done soon so that we can start our trial run before we officially roll out the buses,” he added.The COVID-19 situation had put brakes on the KSTDC’s plan of launching ‘Ambari’ in March this year and one such bus that arrived here from Bengaluru for the launch had to be parked in the KSTDC office premises awaiting the run.Once the preparations are done for the launch, three other ‘Ambari’ buses are also expected to be operated depending on the prevailing situation and the response to the new attraction. Besides four ‘Ambari’ buses to Mysuru, two buses will be operated in Hampi.“The route and other logistics are being worked out for the Hampi tour which may also take off this year,” he said.Ambari is a hop-on, hop-off initiative for tourists to experience the palaces and heritage buildings of Mysuru. Tourists will get an audio guide the moment the bus reaches the tourist sites identified on the route. The audio will be available in two languages in the beginning — Kannada and English. Foreign languages will be added subsequently.The body wrapping of ‘Ambari’ had been done based on the State’s art forms, culture and diversity, wildlife, and tourist destinations.

Indian Institute of Technology Madras researchers have booted up a microprocessor ‘Moushik’.Moushik, a processor-cum-system on a chip that can cater to the rapidly-growing IoT devices, was conceptualised, designed and developed at Pratap Subrahmanyam Centre for Digital Intelligence and Secure Hardware Architecture (PS-CDISHA) of RISE group, Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the institute.The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.V. Kamakoti, one of the members of the Reconfigurable Intelligent Systems Engineering (RISE) group at the CSE department, said the three steps in the making of a microprocessor such as design, fabrication and post-silicon boot-up were taken up in India.“The design of the microprocessor, motherboard printed circuit board design, assembly and post-silicon boot-up were done at IIT Madras. The foundry-specific back-end design and fabrication was undertaken at Semi-Conductor Laboratory of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in Chandigarh and manufacturing of this motherboard was done at Bengaluru. Shakthi Moushik SOC will constitute the heart of an indigenously-developed motherboard called Ardonyx 1.0,” he said.The field application of Moushik includes smart cards, such as credit and debit cards; ID cards; travel cards for Metros and driving licences; electronic voting machines; office management systems including attendance, surveillance cameras and safe locks; personalised health management systems; consumer electronics, including washing machines and water pump monitoring systems.The indigenous microprocessor built to international standards, reduces dependence on other countries and as it is open source the design can be picked up by start ups and customised to their needs. The indigenous effort reduces the risk of deploying systems that may be infected with back-doors and hardware Trojans, the researchers said.

 India has provided 1.54 billion Nepalese Rupees (INR nearly 96 crore) to Nepal as part of its commitment towards assistance and rehabilitation after the 2015 earthquake which saw the death of over 9,000 people in the country, the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu said on Thursday. The financial support was provided as housing and school sector assistance and would further help in the renovation of educational institutions and houses for the people affected in the natural disaster. “The Government of India has provided 1.54 billion Nepali Rupees to Nepal further fulfilling its commitment towards post-earthquake reconstruction assistance,” the Indian Embassy said in a statement. Namgyal Khampa, the Deputy Chief of Mission at the Indian Embassy, handed over the cheque amounting to Nepali Rupees 1.54 billion to Sishir Kumar Dhungana, Secretary, Nepal’s Ministry of Finance. “India has expressed commitment to help rebuild 50,000 private houses in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts, which were destroyed due to the 2015 great earthquake. Of them, 92% construction works have already been completed,” the statement said. “India remains committed to continuing supporting the people and Government of Nepal in their post-earthquake recovery efforts,” it said. Earlier, India also partnered with the United Nations Development Programme and United Nations Office for Project Services for providing socio-technical facilitation to the house owners to ensure that they rebuild their homes as per Nepal government’s earthquake-resilient norms. Central Nepal’s Gorkha district was the epicentre of the devastating earthquake which struck the Himalayan nation in April 2015, claiming over 9,000 lives and damaging 8,00,000 houses. “Nepalese officials have appreciated the sustained and generous humanitarian support extended by India for the post-earthquake reconstruction,” the statement said. India and Nepal in February 2016 signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for $100-million grant to support the reconstruction of 50,000 private houses in the two districts of the Himalayan nation.

Stating the three bills on agriculture passed in Parliament will benefit only corporate companies, Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi (KMDK) general secretary E.R. Eswaran has said that implementation of the new laws will lead to more farmer suicides in the country. In a press release, he said that Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, will affect small and marginal farmers. They will be forced to enter into agreement with corporate companies and sell their produce at a price fixed by the companies. Small and marginal farmers cannot market their produce across the country and retail traders will benefit a lot. The release said that only companies can stock the farm produce which will ultimately lead to price control mechanisms falling under private hands. “Attempts are made to project these laws will increase the income level of farmers which is untrue”, he said and added that the Centre should have consulted the State governments and farmers before introducing the bills. He said that the government had advertised that demonetisation and introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) had benefited the people. “But, there is no doubt that it had a negative impact on the people”, he added.

The rejuvenation of waterbodies, taken up by the district administration exactly a year ago by involving government departments, non-governmental organisations and the public, has yielded good results as agriculture production has gone up substantially in all these areas.This significant achievement has increased the area of cultivation under these waterbodies, thanks to the additional water stored in the renovated irrigation tanks. The most important feature is that these exercises did not cause any expense to the government as the public shared the entire cost.The district administration, in association with Anna University, Chennai, designed a methodology in 2018 to restore the hitherto uncared for waterbodies with the active involvement of the locals for coordinated execution. The prime objective was to renovate the waterbodies with locals’ participation to ensure increased agriculture productivity.The methodology was formulated by demarcating the river region and the responsibility was allocated to all the stakeholders. Based on the processed data, the district administration organised a discussion on the methods to be adopted for the rejuvenation work with the participation of different government departments, institutions, NGOs’ and the public. This methodology was meticulously adopted. Two major works are the renovation of irrigation tanks at Manur and Pallamadai and their supply channels. “In these two major works, Anna University and ‘Nam Tamirabharani Iyakkam’ played laudable roles that significantly increased the storage of the tanks, especially the Manur Periyakulam. The data itself will speak for the work we’ve completed,” says Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish.After the completion of the renovation a year ago, crops were raised on hitherto unused 130 hectares of land under Manur Periyakulam to give additional yield of 1,076 tonnes of paddy in 2019-20.Similarly, the renovation of nearby Pallamadai tank boosted the farmers’ morale and the productivity. “We never imagined of carrying out such a work in this neglected region where the Collector had to neutralise man-made and nature’s hurdles. Ultimately, we have been immensely benefited,” says Mohamed Ibrahim of Manur Farmers’ Association, who mobilised men, material and resources for the completion of these two works.

 Karnataka Legislative Assembly Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri on Thursday admitted a notice on no-confidence motion given by the principal Opposition Congress against the BJP government in Karnataka.The Speaker informed the Assembly that he would allot time on Friday or Saturday for a discussion on the no-trust notice signed by 23 Congress members.As soon as the House met after paying rich tributes to Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi, who succumbed to COVID-19, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah raised the issue of notice on non-confidence motion and said the State government has lost confidence of the House and urged the Speaker to give a priority for debate on the no-trust motion.“When the House has no confidence in the government, how will you continue”, Mr. Siddaramaiah said and demanded the Speaker to take up the no confidence motion discussion first before taking any other issues.Countering the claims made by Mr. Siddaramaiah, Revenue Minister R Ashok said the Congress has no mandate in the state as well as in the country. “The notice on non-trust motion is nothing but political gimmick”, he said.The government has majority and it was ready to prove majority in the House. But many members of the Congress already quit the party and many would quit soon. “We don’t know how many will remain in the Congress”, Mr. Ashok said.When Mr. Askok stood up to table Bills, H K Patil (Congress) said the government should not be allowed to table bills after the Speaker admitted the notice on non-trust motion. Mr. Kageri termed Mr. Patil’s suggestion as his personal view and allowed Mr. Ashok table two bills in the House.CLP meetingEarlier, M.r Siddaramaiah chaired a meeting of the Congress Legislator’s Party (CLP) and decided to move the no-confidence motion against the government. He claimed that the government has lost people’s confidence and alleged that family members of Chief Minister B. S.

 Google India Digital Services Pvt. Ltd., which operates the GPay app, has told the Delhi High Court that it is allowed to share customers transaction data with third parties with the prior permission of NPCI and payment service provider (PSP) banks.The submission has been made by Google in its affidavit filed before a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan in response to a PIL seeking action against ‘Google Pay’ (GPay) for allegedly violating the RBI’s guidelines related to data localisation, storage and sharing.The High Court on September 24 listed the matter for hearing on November 10 as the Centre and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have not filed their responses yet.Google, in its affidavit, has contended that under the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) procedural guidelines, issued by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), apps like GPay are permitted to share customers transaction data with third parties and group companies with prior permission of NPCI and PSP banks.It has also said that GPay only stores ordinary customer data — like name, address, email ID and transaction related details — in accordance with the NPCI guidelines and not payment sensitive data like debit card number or UPI PIN.A customer’s payment sensitive data is stored only on the servers of the PSP bank, it has claimed.The affidavit was filed in response to the petition by advocate Abhishek Sharma who has sought a direction to Google not to share any data from UPI switch with any other party.Google has contended that it was complying with the NPCI procedural guidelines which govern functioning of all third party application providers (TPAPs) like GPay.It has also claimed that the petition was not maintainable as Mr. Sharma has available to him several alternate remedies like the customer care feature in the app or approaching the NPCI in accordance with the Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007 or asking RBI to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction.Google has further contended that there are other TPAPs like GPay, but the petition has been “selectively filed” against it.Mr. Sharma, in his plea, has also sought a direction to Google to give an undertaking to not store data on its app under UPI ecosystem and further not to share it with any third party, including its holding or parent company.The plea has claimed that the company was storing personal sensitive data in contravention of UPI procedural guidelines of October 2019, which allows such data to be stored only by PSP bank systems and not by any third party application.Google has denied the claim, saying customers’ payment sensitive data is stored with the PSP banks and GPay only accesses it in accordance with the guidelines.It has also denied the allegation that it accesses customers’ location to gain revenue from offering highly targeted or personalised advertising opportunities to advertisers.

An application was filed jointly by Sangeeta Tyagi, the widow of Congress national spokesperson Rajeev Tyagi, and author Kota Neelima, in the Supreme Court on Thursday, saying that certain TV anchors peddle hate to further the government’s narrative.They have sought the permission of the court to intervene in a pending case against Sudarshan TV’s ‘Bindas Bol’ programme, which accused Muslims of “infiltrating” the Civil Services with the help of terror-linked organisations abroad.“There is a steady and almost irreversible trend clearly visible these days, whereby the TV anchors and TV debates have debased and degenerated themselves into blatant purveyors of hate speech,” the application, filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes, said.It said the reasons for this state of affairs are manifold.“Though increase in Television Rating Point (TRP) seems to be the immediate and ostensible objective, as however the ‘remote control’ of such TV debates by the political class in power, to create and popularise a narrative that would suit their electoral and ideological objectives and discredit, demonise and vilify their political and ideological opponents cannot be ruled out,” the application said.A three-judge Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud had stayed the telecast of ‘Bindas Bol’. The Bench is looking into the aspect of strengthening the independent self-regulatory mechanism for electronic media. The court is also examining what constitutes hate speech on air.The application said, “the situation of the electronic media in our country bears unhappy and undesirable parallels with Nazi Germany, at least with regards to ‘hate speeches in the electronic media’”.The application said Mr. Tyagi was himself an unfortunate victim of hate speech on electronic media. He had suffered a fatal heart attack immediately after the TV debate.

More local communities in T ripura are up in arms against the resettlement of the Brus displaced from adjoining Mizoram.Members of the Halam community, a Scheduled Tribe of Tripura, also called Riam, on Thursday prevented surveyors from assessing land in the Churaibari area in Dharmanagar Subdivision of North Tripura district. The area borders Assam. People belonging to the Manipuri and Muslim communities in the area too protested the proposed settlement of Bru refugees in the area. This was the first instance of conflict over the issue of resettling the internally-displaced Brus beyond the Kanchanpur and Panisagar Subdivisions of North Tripura district. The sizeable Bengali, Mizo and local Brus – also called Reangs – have been against the settling of the Bru refugees near the areas they inhabit.Ethnic violence in Mizoram More than 35,000 Brus displaced due to ethnic violence in Mizoram since 1997 are currently distributed among seven relief camps in these two subdivisions. Leaders of the refugees, in January, signed a quadripartite agreement with the Centre and the Mizoram and Tripura governments for rehabilitation in Tripura instead of returning to “uncertainty” in Mizoram. “We are not against Bru resettlement but the Tripura government must settle them somewhere else. Our land and resources are very limited and sharing them with more people belonging to a different community will leave us with nothing. We cannot let this happen,” said Moni Ranglong, a Halam leader. He added that all villagers in the area blocked the road of surveyors guided by a plan to settle 1,000 displaced Bru families in forest land around Balicherra village in the Churaibari area. The locals practice jhum or shifting cultivation on the wooded slopes.Warning of long-term stirThe Ranglong Youth Association also submitted a memorandum to North Tripura’s District Magistrate warning of a long-term agitation if the authorities persist with the “mass settlement of any outside community”. Other local communities elsewhere in the district have also vowed to carry on demonstrating against the mass settlement of Brus. The Joint Movement Committee comprising Bengali and Mizo organisations enforced a shutdown across Kanchanpur Subdivision on September 22. “We can allow up to 500 Bru refugee families to be settled in areas of our choice,” committee leader Susanta Bikas Barua said.Local Brus of four villages -- Urehampara, Donjoylapara, Nouhbaraipra and Gomohonpara – have also opposed the settlement of the displaced Brus near their areas despite the ethnic similarity. The displaced Brus, however, want the government to honour the agreement and settle them in clusters of at least 500 families.

TikTok’s owner said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license as it tries to complete a deal with Oracle and Walmart to keep the popular video app operating in the United States. Beijing tightened control over technology exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington’s attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.President Donald Trump said this week he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle Corp. and Walmart Inc. could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. Mr. Trump said Oracle must have total control.  ByteDance said it applied to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce for an export license and was awaiting a reply. The one-sentence statement gave no other details. Chinese authorities have not indicated whether they will agree to a transfer of technology. But official newspapers criticised the proposed deal this week as bullying and extortion. China has no reason to give the green light to such a deal, which is dirty and unfair, said the newspaper China Daily on Wednesday. On Thursday, the foreign ministry said China will take necessary measures to safeguard its companies but gave no indication what steps it can take to affect TikTok’s fate in the United States. A Ministry spokesman, Wang Wenbin, called on Washington to respect the principles of market economy and fair competition and provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for foreign companies.

Following repeated incidents of man-elephant conflict in parts of Hassan district, the district-level officers of the Forest Department have written to the department seeking permission to radio-collar four more elephants and capture two problematic elephants. So far, four elephants have been radio-collared; however, equipment installed on three animals have stopped responding.More than 60 elephants spread over four-five groups have been roaming around areas of Sakleshpur, Yeslur and Alur forest ranges of Hassan district. Every day, farmers complain to the Forest Department of crop damage due to the movement of the herds. A priest died on September 1 at Kollahalli near Sakleshpur, while he was near his house. Such incidents have forced the growers to put pressure on the State government demanding a permanent solution to the problem. They have urged the government to capture all elephants roaming in the area.The rapid response teams formed by the Forest Department keep track of herds’ movement and alert local people so that man-elephant conflicts could be avoided. However, this exercise does not help in bringing down the instances of crop damage. The farmers cannot visit their farms for several days as the herds roam there. B.R. Manjunath, a planter at Ballupete, said the farmers had been losing patience over the repeated incidents of crop damage. “We don’t know how to protect our crops. If a coffee plant is lost due to elephants, the government pays ₹200 as compensation. But, we have spent years to grow it. How long the growers should tolerate this?”, he asked. Like him, many have conveyed their problems to the Forest Department.Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu that he was aware of the problems faced by the growers. “We are doing what best can be done. Right now four elephants are radio-collared. We have to replace the batteries of three instruments. Besides that, I have written to the department to conduct an operation to radio-collar four more. Once it is done, we will be tracking the movement of eight elephants so that location of herds could be tracked easily”, he said.Similarly, the department has also identified two elephants for capture and relocation. “Considering their behaviour, we have identified two tuskers for capture. The operation will be done once rains stop”, he added.

Gupteshwar Pandey, the tough-talking IPS officer who stepped down as Bihar police chief late Tuesday night, hogged media limelight a day after and dropped hints about joining politics, asserting he is a “free man” now and that contesting elections is not illegal.The voluble former top cop of the state was chased and courted by national television through the day but what they succeeded in wangling out of him for now was that he is still not a political person, but being a “free man” now, he could join politics if people want him to do so.“I am now a free citizen of India like you. I am no longer the DGP. So, no service rules apply to me anymore.Thousands of people are coming from Buxar, Begusarai, Jehanabad, Aurangabad and other districts. I will take a decision after talking to them. Contesting elections is not illegal,” he told journalists. The assertive officer is often called ‘Robinhood Pandey’ by his band of supporters.Mr. Pandey, who had come in for criticism from politicians in Maharashtra for strongly pleading for a CBI probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, however, said he was “exasperated” at suggestions that he did so because of his political ambitions.“I have spent more than three decades in (police) service and nobody can raise a finger at my professional integrity. But, in the recent past, thousands of calls and messages seeking to know when I am entering politics, which party I am planning to join.....left me exasperated,” Mr. Pandey said.When journalists persisted with questions about whether he has plans to join politics, he said, “I have neither joined any political party nor I am a political person till now. When I join (a party), I will tell all of you before I do.“Politics is not the only way of serving society. One can work for society in different ways even without joining politics.” Mr. Pandey, a daring IPS officer known for his rustic mannerisms, had sought voluntary retirement in 2009 amid speculation that he wanted to contest the Lok Sabha election from Buxar. It was rumoured that the BJP wanted to field him from the seat which has substantial Brahmin votes.The saffron party changed its mind and did not field Mr. Pandey.In a rare concession by a state government for an IPS officer who had voluntarily quit service, the ruling dispensation in Bihar sat over his resignation for nine months and then reinstated him.The officer, at whose suggestion, the Bihar government had recommended a CBI probe into the death of Patna-born actor Sushant Singh Rajput in Mumbai, rubbished suggestions that his outspokenness in the case was in anyway linked to his political ambitions.The officer had virtually waged an all-out war with Maharashtra politicians on national television in support of a CBI investigation in Rajput’s death case, asserting that it alone could do “justice” to the deceased actor.In line of Shiv Sena fire, Mr. Pandey, who has a fan following among a section of the youth in Bihar, was unflappable, and declared he will do everything to get the actor justice.The VRS request of Mr. Pandey, who would have retired in February 2021, was accepted by Governor Phagu Chauhan on Tuesday, the day he tendered his resignation.“The Bihar DGP who was used for this defamation is being blatantly rewarded. His voluntary retirement says it all,” said Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant in Mumbai, reacting to reports that Pandey could take the political plunge. While a government officer has to give three months’ notice before resigning, Mr. Pandey’s resignation was accepted immediately, he said.Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut, with whom Mr. Pandey had locked horns over the issue of a CBI probe in Rajput’s death case, also claimed the former Bihar DGP was being “rewarded” for speaking against Mumbai and Maharashtra.Mr. Pandey, who had said actress Rhea Chakraborth had no ’aukaat’ (stature) to comment on Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s decision to recommend a CBI probe in the case, defended his statement.“Someone who is an accused in the case and named in an FIR for hatching a conspiracy to kill Sushant Singh Rajput has no right to make any comment against a person who is occupying a constitutional post,” Mr. Pandey said.Bihar’s ruling JD(U) preferred silence on Mr. Pandey seeking voluntary retirement or his political ambition, ally BJP said everyone has the right to lead a social and political life in a democratic set up.“Gupteshwar Pandey jee had joined the service on his own sweet will and has now opted for VRS. There is no scope left for a political party to make any suggestion about what he should do. He has every right to choose a political party or ideology he wants to pursue,” state BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said.

Consumption of ayurvedic medicines/products has increased during COVID-19 pandemic with the Indian Medicines Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited (IMPCL), a government enterprise and manufacturer of ayurveda and unani medicines, registering sales of ₹69.60 crore up to August 2020 as compared to last year’s ₹26.73 crore out of which the IMPCL has sold COVID-19 medicines approximately ₹30 crore to the various Central/State institutions/Autonomous as well as open market across the country.The Ministry of Ayush replying to a question in the Lok Sabha earlier this week said it had at the beginning of the pandemic written to all States/UTS with specific suggestions on augmentation of general immunity of people and about possible AYUSH intervention.It said the manufacture for sale of Ayurvedic drugs required valid licence from State Licensing Authorities under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 & Rules 1945.“The Ministry of AYUSH issued an advisory in January on how to protect oneself from COVID and how to stay healthy and followed it up with individual correspondence to States and UTs. It also issued self-care guidelines for preventive health measures and boosting immunity with special reference to respiratory health,’’ it said.It said early on in the pandemic it has written to the Health Ministry also offering for integrating and utilising the huge AYUSH infrastructure to combat the pandemic and also to principals of all Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy (ASU&H) colleges (approximately 727) for offering their services to local health authorities for utilisation of the facilities by them as the situation arises. The Ayush Sanjivani mobile app developed by the Ministry of AYUSH has also been launched to generate data on acceptance and usage of AYUSH advocacies and measures among the population and its impact in prevention of COVID-19 targeting over 4 million population.“These studies are at various stages. The Ministry of AYUSH and Department of Biotechnology (DBT) has taken an initiative to explore the areas of opportunities to collaborate on research on COVID-19. Under joint AYUSH-DBT Network Programme, a project has been designed to evaluate anti-viral and immune-modulatory activity of AYUSH herbs and formulations,’’ said the Ministry.

A political slugfest appears to be on the cards as the Bharatiya Janata Party government in the State has tabled an eight-and-half-year-old report on the “misuse and encroachment” of Wakf properties before the State legislature.The report. readied on March 23, 2012, by the then chairman of the Karnataka State Minorities Commission Anwar Manippady has kicked up political dust afresh as it names several prominent politicians, particularly those in the Congress, including Mallikarjun Kharge, Dharam Singh, Rehman Khan, Jaffer Sharief, MLAs Khaneer Fathima Qamur-ul-Islam, N.A. Haris, his wife Tahera Haris and mother Suraiah Mohammed, as those among the ones responsible for “misuse and encroachment” of Wakf properties.Others who have been named in the report include MLA Roshan Baig, former Union Minister C. Ibrahim, former Ministers Qamur-ul-Islam and Hindasgeri, former MP Narasing Rao Suryavamshi and former MLAs Iqbal Ansari and Syed Yasin.The tabling coincides with the Opposition mounting its attack on the government over several issues including the charges of corruption and improper handling of the COVID-19 situation.The report, which has listed encroachment as well as misuse of properties in each of the districts, says that 1,803 acres of the total 2,586 acres in Bidar alone have been encroached.The report has described the “massive” encroachment and misappropriation as “only the tip of the iceberg.” Alleging that “Wakf mafia” has joined hands with Wakf Board in the scam, it has observed that the volume of the scam is not smaller than 2-G scam that rocked the country earlier.It has recommended to the government to take the Wakf Board into its control and begin the task of cleansing it. It has recommended that an inquiry should be conducted through the Lokayukta besides initiating legal process by suspending the Wakf Committee for a year.It has also recommended constitution of a task force to recover the Wakf properties in accordance with the Supreme Court’s verdict with respect to a civil appeal in 1998; and constitution of a high-level committee to run the Karnataka State Wakf Board in a transparent manner and set an agenda in this regard.

The members of Kodagu Zilla Panchayat have met Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa and urged him to release a sum of ₹20 crore for urgent repair of roads that have become unmotorable following heavy rains over the last three years.Kodagu had witnessed widespread floods and landslides three years in a row, resulting in extensive damage to the road infrastructure and causing hardships to the local people. The bad roads have led to resentment against the elected representatives, especially the members of the Zilla Panchayat whom the public are blaming for the apathy.The public have been resorting to novel protests across the district demanding immediate repair and asphalting of damaged roads. There have been instances of public planting saplings on the potholed roads to vent their ire.A delegation from the Kodagu ZP led by president Harish met Mr. Eshwarappa in Bengaluru on Tuesday and apprised him of the condition of roads besides the urgency for releasing funds for their repair and asphalting.In a letter to Mr. Eshwarappa, Mr. Harish said tourists had been sharing messages and photos on the poor condition of roads in Kodagu on various social media platforms.He sought an immediate grant of ₹20 crore for improving the condition of roads.

Harley-Davidson Inc. has announced that it will discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India and shed about 70 jobs in the country as part of a global strategic restructuring plan ‘The Rewire’.“Harley-Davidson plans to close its manufacturing facility in Bawal and significantly reduce the size of its sales office in Gurgaon,” the U.S. motorcycle major said in a statement. “The company is communicating with its customers in India and will keep them updated on future support. The Harley-Davidson dealer network will continue to serve customers through the contract term,” it said.Also read | U.S. President Donald Trump again points to Indian tariffs on Harley-Davidson bikeHarley’s decision to exit one of the world’s largest markets for two-wheelers — domestic motorcycle and scooter sales in the 12 months ended March 2020 exceeded 17 million units — follows a struggle to find takers for its bikes, including the Street, which saw it register sale of less than 2,500 units in the last financial year.The U.S. company’s decision to exit manufacturing also undermines the government’s efforts to attract and retain global manufacturers as it aims to woo investment from firms looking to exit China.Observing that it was changing its business model in India and evaluating options to continue to serve its customers, the company said, “These actions are aligned with ‘The Rewire’... leading to ‘The Hardwire’, a new strategic plan for 2021-2025 aimed at building desirability for the Harley-Davidson brand and products.”In a filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, Harley said, “the Company expects to incur restructuring expenses of approximately $75 million in 2020, of which approximately 80% are expected to be cash expenditures, including one-time termination benefits of approximately $3 million”.The company expects to complete restructuring within the next 12 months. Harley has been scrambling for years to grow sales beyond baby boomers in the U.S. and has not posted retail sales growth there in the past 14 quarters, Reuters reported.Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, who took the reins at the company in February, had unveiled a major shift in strategy to boost profits by reducing Harley’s product portfolio by 30% and investing in 50 markets with growth potential in North America, Europe and parts of Asia Pacific.India, still far cheaper and poorer than many of the developing economies with which it competes for investment, has proven an inhospitable market for other auto industry players.Last year, Ford Motor Co pared back its interests and ceased independent operations in India by entering into a joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra.General Motors, which stopped domestic sales in 2017, also plans to stop manufacturing and exports from India by the end of this year.(With inputs from Reuters)

 The government is working on an “ambitious” plan to gradually withdraw border guarding forces such as the Border Security Force (BSF), the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) Force and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) from internal security duties in order to strengthen protection at various frontiers of the country, official sources said on Thursday. They said the proposal was first discussed during a meeting of these forces chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah last year. According to the proposal, accessed by PTI, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is working on a new “model” where the burden of internal security duties, including conduct of elections, will be largely borne by the country’s largest paramilitary force, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).In LAC talks, from peace to conflict prevention | China's LAC aggression, India's obfuscation The 3.25 lakh strong CRPF is already designated as the lead internal security force of the country. Officials in the security establishment, quoting the proposal, said that a new experiment will be put in place during the forthcoming elections in Bihar and bypolls in some States where the CRPF will be deployed in a 70:30 ratio along with State police forces. “The CRPF will be the overall security in-charge during conduct of polls. Border guarding forces such as the Border Security Force, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force and the Sashastra Seema Bal will be gradually withdrawn from these duties,” a senior official said.LAC standoff | 10 patrolling points in eastern Ladakh blocked by Chinese People’s Liberation Army, says senior official “It is envisaged by the Home Ministry that these three forces will be taken off completely from rendering routine internal security duties such as elections and law and order duties in aid to State governments over the next few years,” the official said. Every year, thousands of troops of these border forces are withdrawn from the front and sent for conduct of elections apart from duties to strengthen law and order arms of various State police forces in view of the challenging internal security scenario in their domains. The official said the border guarding forces have already been directed to strengthen security at their respective fronts including by operationalising more posts and reducing inter-border out post distance.Is the Quad rising after China's challenge at the LAC? While the BSF is tasked with guarding sensitive International Borders with Pakistan (over 3,300km) and Bangladesh (4,096km), the ITBP mans the 3,488km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China while the SSB guards open Indian fronts with Nepal (1,751km) and Bhutan (699km). The Assam Rifles, under the administrative control of the MHA but manned by army personnel and officers, guards the border with Myanmar. The Home Ministry has also directed the three border forces to create a team of their “young officers” who will traverse through the entire border area under their charge and bring to record the “smallest of security challenges” for discussion and resolution. The Ministry has also proposed that a special cell be created in the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to deal with border crime cases including cattle smuggling and check activities of smugglers, fake Indian currency notes operatives and corrupt government officers.What explains the India-China border flare-up? A team of officers of these frontier guarding forces has also been created who have been tasked with finding ways to ensure that migration of border population is stopped and they are provided work opportunities in their local areas, the officer said. The Ministry, as per the proposal, has also directed that a committee of officers headed by the Union Home Secretary should discuss development of new technology tools for border guarding in consultation with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL). A specific mention has been made to find solutions, with help from agriculture experts, to check the menace of sarkanda or elephant grass along the International Border with Pakistan. The elephant grass aids terrorists to infiltrate, smuggle narcotics and dig tunnels as it cuts the line of vision of BSF troops who guard the area, the officer said. A review of these issues is expected to be held by the Home Ministry next month, an officer in the Ministry said.

A report of the UN Secretary General on child and forced marriages has taken note of national policies and capacity-building initiatives taken in India to promote gender and child-sensitive health services, including for girls subjected to such alliances, and “promising experiences” about supporting those affected by the practices.The Report of Secretary General Antonio Guterres on “Issue of child, early and forced marriage,” which covers the period from June 2018 to May 2020, said that several States adopted legislative and policy measures to raise the minimum age of marriage and also put in place comprehensive strategies to combat child, early and forced marriage.The report contains an overview of progress made towards ending child, early and forced marriages worldwide. For example, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Mozambique, the Niger and Uganda developed national policies and guidelines and undertook capacity-building initiatives to promote more gender and child-sensitive health and protection services, including for girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage, the report said. The report also includes promising experiences with programmes aimed at ending those practices and supporting already married girls and women affected by the practices. It added that in India, adolescents are involved in the “Ladli Samman” campaign, which consists of the mapping of social and economic vulnerabilities and linking them to social protection schemes and counselling support. The report noted that the empowerment of girls at risk and that of already married women and girls can also be promoted by ensuring their access to economic assets and by strengthening their financial independence and their livelihood and entrepreneurship skills.  Families suffering from financial instability are more likely to regard daughters as an economic burden, in particular when unable to finance a daughter’s education, and consequently justify their early marriage, the report said. In India, the UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage supported the Kanyashree Prakalpa programme of West Bengal through conditional cash transfers to encourage their continued education and prevent child marriage. The report said that countries and other stakeholders have also undertaken efforts towards addressing the specific needs of girls and women affected by child, early and forced marriage. In India, the Institute of Health Management contributed to empowering several dozens of married girls. They had the opportunity to obtain access to health, educational, economic and legal support. Another programme reported by UNICEF refers to more than 1,500 adolescent girls trained as digital champions (sathis) who had produced 103 short videos covering positive stories of resistance to, or avoidance of, child marriage. According to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), in the past decade, 25 million child marriages have been prevented globally thanks to the increased rate of girls’ education, the proactive investment of governments in adolescent girls and the raising of the public’s awareness of the harms and illegality of child marriage. However, globally, the total number of married girls is estimated to be 12 million per year. The prevalence rate of child, early and forced marriage remain high, in particular in some regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which represent 18% and 44%, respectively, of the global burden. A marked reduction in the prevalence rate was recorded in South Asia, however, the prevalence in Latin America and the Caribbean has remained stagnant for 25 years. No region is on track to eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the lives of children and families across the globe, negatively affecting efforts towards ending child, early and forced marriage and unions. Reports are emerging from Africa and Asia in particular of an increase in the number of early or child marriages, the report said.

Spaniard Manuel Arribas Rodriguez had intended to stay a week at Bokotial when he pedalled into the Assamese village on Valentine’s Day earlier this year.He ended up spending more than seven months at the village in eastern Assam’s Sivasagar district thanks to the series of pandemic-induced lockdowns.And on September 22, almost everyone from Bokotial turned up at Simaluguri, the nearest railway station, to bid an emotional farewell to Mr. Rodriguez who boarded the Rajdhani Express to New Delhi. He is scheduled to fly out to Madrid on Friday.“It was heartbreaking to let Manuel bopai (son) go. But I feel happy for his parents who will get to see their biological son after so many months,” said Dipeswar Chutia, the headman of the village of 10 Assamese households.The 41-year-old Spaniard, who worked at a hotel in Spain for 10 years, had planned to cover most Asian countries on his bicycle. He flew to Tokyo last year, cycled around Japan before reaching the India-Myanmar border on January 27 via South Korea and the Southeast Asian countries.“I met him at a youth festival in a college about 14 km from our village. We conversed in broken English and I invited him to our village as he was interested in local culture. He turned up on February 14 after touring other parts of the State,” recalled Biswajit Barbaruah.During his extended and enforced holiday, Mr. Rodriguez stayed with the Barbaruahs, helped with the chores, learnt paddy farming and took part in community fishing and other village activities. He also taught the children of the village to play the guitar and speak Spanish apart from forming a bicycle and exercising club.“The lockdown happened as Manuel da (elder brother) was preparing to leave. We informed the local authorities, who tested his health and got in touch with the Spanish Embassy,” Mr. Barbaruah said.“We helped him get his visa extended. It was the least we could do for a foreigner who was stranded because of circumstances no one could have predicted,” said Sivasagar’s Assistant Tourist Information Officer Madhab Das.Mr. Rodriguez said his visit to Bokotial on Valentine’s Day could have been predestined.“I fell in love with the village. I can never forget the hospitality of the people, the kind I have never experienced anywhere else,” he said, hoping to return after the novel coronavirus no longer remains a threat.

The Fascino 125 has a big task ahead as Yamaha is pinning hopes on this new 125cc scooter platform for a boost to its scooter fortunes in India.Yamaha seems to have used the previous Fascino’s design as the basis for the new Fascino 125, and that is not a bad thing. Some elements that stand out include the inverted triangle-style headlamp, chrome embellishments on the apron and the flowing tail section.The body panels and switches are neatly put together, but while there are a lot of plastic panels, the front fender is a metal unit.However, the downside of form winning over function is that the ergonomics are slightly flawed.The footboard has an aggressive upward sweep that makes it difficult to comfortably accommodate big feet. The relatively low-set handlebar grazes your knee while taking tight turns, if you are anything above 5ft 8in tall. Also, the seat squab is tad too soft for longish stints, resulting in a sore backside after half an hour of saddle time.There are no LED lamps, and the instrument cluster is so basic it does not even get a trip meter. Thankfully, the Yamaha’s engine makes up for all this.SpecificationsEngine: 125cc, single-cylinder, SOHC, air-cooledMax power: 8.2hp at 6500rpmMax torque: 9.7Nm at 5000rpmOverall Length x Width x Height: 1,920 x 685 x 1,150 mmSeat height: 780mmWheelbase: 1280mmMinimum ground clearance: 145mmKerb weight (with oil & a full fuel tank): 99kgFuel tank capacity: 5.2 litresUnderseat storage: 21 litresSuspension type(Front/Rear): Telescopic fork/Unit swingTyre size (F|R ): 90/90-12 | 110/90-10 Brake type (Front): Disc(190mm)/DrumBrake type(Rear): DrumAlong with developing a brand-new chassis, Yamaha also developed a new 125cc engine with a nifty starter-motor generator for a silent start.The fuel-injected engine’s power and torque figures (8.2hp and 9.7Nm) are nothing to write home about. Yamaha has an ace up its sleeve with the power-to-weight ratio, which is down to 99kg kerb weight. As expected, the 82.82hp/tonne power-to-weight ratio translates to brisk performance, and the Fascino 125 is right up there with the competition. In the sprint from 0-60kph, the Fascino clocked 8.41sec, 0.33sec slower than the Suzuki Access 125.The engine is responsive as well, which is apparent in its roll-on acceleration times (20-50kph in 4.57sec and 30-70kph in 10.52sec), and that makes the Fascino an effortless city commuter. But what impresses is the engine’s refinement. Whether it was riding at sedate city speeds or flat out on the Mumbai-Pune highway, there were hardly any perceptible vibrations to speak of.The other advantage of the low kerb weight is the fuel economy. The Fascino returned 57.08kpl in the city and 64.2kpl on the highway, making it the among the most fuel-efficient BS6 125cc models we have tested.The Fascino’s engine stop/start feature does help in extracting a little more fuel economy, but the system is slow to respond and the engine takes a little over a second to turn on after you have opened the throttle. The new Fascino 125 is lacking in its low-speed ride. The telescopic fork and monoshock is set up on the firm side of the scale, resulting in a low-speed ride that is not exactly harsh, but it is not what you would call comfy either.Pick up the pace and there is a noticeable improvement in the ride quality. High-speed stability and handling are both perfectly acceptable, but not segment-leading. The braking performance offered by the Yamaha Fascino’s front disc is also decent, though the optional front disc lacks some bite.  Yamaha intends to snatch some of the 125cc market share from the competition and that is evident in its aggressive pricing. Starting at ₹68,730 for the drum brake variant and ₹71, 230 for the disc brake one, the Fascino undercuts some of its 125cc competition. Those who buy the Fascino for its looks won’t get segment-best comfort, dynamics or features, but will enjoy its performance, efficiency and promise of Japanese reliability. For many, that will be enough.All prices, ex-showroom, Delhi

The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Thursday recommended a compensation of ₹1.75 lakh to an individual, who was taken into custody by women police, in connection with a domestic dispute, despite producing a copy of Chief Kazi, who had granted a divorce from his wife. The Commission also recommended the Home Secretary for initiating departmental action against four women police personnel, involved in the case, as per the rules.Passing orders on a complaint by H. Abul Hassan of K.K. Nagar in Chennai, SHRC member A. Chittaranjan Mohandoss also recommended the Home Secretary to recover the sum of compensation from Lakshmi, then Women Inspector of Police, Pasupathy, then Sub Inspector of Police, Meerabai and Varalakshmi, then Women Head Constables -- all attached to R3 Ashok Nagar All Women Police Station - a sum of ₹1 lakh and ₹25,000 from them respectively.According to complainant H. Abul Hassan, he was illegally arrested by the respondents, despite producing a proof that the Government Chief Kazi by his official order on January 27, 2013 had granted a divorce from his wife by way of ‘Talaq’. Despite the order of Chief Kazi, after a period of eight years, he was arrested by the respondents illegally and hence the complaint.The complainant’s wife had an illegal affair with another man and hence the divorce, he said. Both Chief Kazi and the Principal Judge of the Family Court in Chennai had ordered in his favour for the custody of both his children, the complainant said. The Madras High Court too had dismissed the habeas corpus plea filed by his former wife in 2012, he said. While so, on December 19, 2012, a group of goons barged into his house and assaulted his family members and the complaint filed by his father in K.K. Nagar Police Station was not acted upon, he said. When his visited the house to collect his belongings, he was assaulted by his former wife and her family members and when he attempted to file a complaint with Ashok Nagar Police Station, it refused to accept his complaint, he alleged.After he moved a criminal original petition before the Madras High Court seeking to register a complaint against his former wife and her family members, it ordered in his favour. But, the Inspector summoned him for enquiry on a complaint filed by his former wife who alleged that he demanded dowry and also to handover the custody of children to her. Though he appeared for enquiry, his former wife did not appear. Though he produced that he had obtained a divorce from his former wife through Chief Kazi, the police personnel did not check the documents, he said.After hearing arguments from both sides, the Commission passed the orders in favour of the complainant on Thursday.

The Bombay High Court allowed Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officer Bhagyavant Late to file their replies to a plea filed by actor Kangana Ranaut after the civic body demolished her bungalow in Bandra.Also read: Undue importance being given to Kangana’s remarks: Sharad PawarAdvocate Pradeep Thorat, for Mr. Raut, and senior advocate Anil Sakhare, appearing for Mr. Late, sought time before a Division Bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla to file their replies.Mr. Thorat said he needed time to file an affidavit as Mr. Raut, being an MP, is in Delhi. The Bench, however, made a remark on the BMC seeking time to reply. “You need more time here but otherwise you are very fast [in demolishing],” it said.While allowing them time to do so, the court said, “since 40% of the Petitioner’s [Ms. Ranaut] Bungalow is already demolished on 9th September, 2020 and the Bungalow continues to stand in partially demolished condition since then, it is likely that some mishap may be caused due to the heavy rainfall in Mumbai. It is therefore necessary to hear the matter at the earliest.”The Bench thus directed senior advocate Birendra Saraf, representing the actor, to commence his arguments on September 25 at 3 p.m.On September 9, the BMC undertook a drive to demolish the alleged illegal portions of Ms. Ranaut’s office. Soon thereafter, the court directed the BMC to stay the process of demolition.A ‘stop work’ notice was issued by the BMC on September 8 under Section 354A of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act (power of Designated Officer to stop erection of building or work commenced or carried on unlawfully) was issued to Ms. Ranaut on September 8 pertaining to substantial alterations and additions carried out unlawfully.

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has recommended an investigation into the Indian Air Force (IAF)’s purchase of five Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) engines in 2010, noting that the same engines were purchased by a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) laboratory at almost one-third the price two years later, resulting in an undue gain for the vendor of ₹3.16 crore. The CAG recommended “fixing of responsibility for wrongful supply and acceptance of mis-labelled engines by the IAF.” “Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) Ltd. gained an undue benefit of ₹3.16 crore as it supplied five UAV engines at more than three times the market price. The vendor supplied uncertified engines while the contract was concluded for certified engines,” the CAG said in a report tabled in Parliament on Wednesday. “There were many reported accidents involving these uncertified engines including loss of one UAV in a flying accident,” the report said.

 Rotax enginesIn March 2010, Air headquarters concluded a contract with IAI of Israel for the supply of accessories and spares of Heron UAV, at a cost of $136.43 mn (₹9.07 crore), which included supply of five Rotax 914 F3 engines to be fitted on the Herons. The Rotax engines used in Herons are manufactured by an Austrian company consisting of 914F, which is certified engine while, 914UL is an uncertified engine.The average price of Rotax engines in the international market then was around ₹21 lakh to ₹25 lakh. The audit noted that Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), a DRDO lab, had procured the same variant of Rotax 914F in April 2012.The ADE had procured 914F engines at ₹24.30 lakh each from Verman Aviation, an authorised Indian supplier of Rotax. However, IAI supplied the 914UL engine to IAF in 2010 for ₹87.45 lakh each — “more than three times the price paid by DRDO or the market price.”Contract contravenedThe contract stipulated that the engine to be supplied was of specifications 914F3 which is certified by the European Aviation Standard Agency. However, documents submitted to the CAG pertaining to the delivery of one of the five engines show that the vendor had supplied uncertified engine 914UL.A team of IAF and IAI representatives carried out the Joint Receipt Inspection (JRI) of the consignment and accepted the engines in January 2012, but they could not detect the fact that the delivery was not in accordance with the contract as they did not have a copy of the contract while carrying out the inspection. Further, according to the contract the engines were to be delivered at an Equipment Depot (ED) of IAF “which was the ultimate consignee” but records showed that one of the engines was delivered at an Air Force station and not the designated ED, the CAG noted.

Benchmark stock indices slumped on Thursday taking a cue from the sell-off witnessed in the U.S. and European markets. The diversion of funds from secondary market to the primary market by investors seeking to bid in multiple Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) also added to the meltdown, analysts said, adding that the market would remain weak in the days ahead.The S&P BSE Sensex slid 1,115 points, or 2.96%, to settle at 36,553.60 points. Barring HUL, all the remaining 29 stocks in the 30-share Sensex ended with losses. Major losers included IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, M&M, TCS, Tech Mahindra and Tata Steel. The NSE Nifty also plunged 326 points, or 2.93%, to 10,805.50. Top losers included IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance, Grasim, and TCS. “Indian markets are following the global trend of sharp overnight sell-off in the U.S., EU,” Arjun Yash Mahajan, head — Institutional Business at Reliance Securities, said. “Asia opened weak and India followed the trend,” he added.“Additionally, if we see, foreign portfolio investors have been sellers for most of this week,” he added.IPOs sucking liquidity“Finally, the list of IPOs that have hit the market is also sucking out liquidity from the secondary market. Elections and other political events in the U.S. will continue to have an impact and act as an overhang. It may not come as a surprise if we see continued weakness in India for some more time,” Mr. Mahajan said.The selling pressure was widespread wherein IT, banking and auto were the top losers, Ajit Mishra, VP, Research, Religare Broking Ltd., said. He said the looming uncertainty over the stimulus package in the U.S., combined with the issue of rising COVID-19 cases worldwide, had raised concerns over the economic recovery. “And, it may deteriorate further if the virus situation results in partial lockdown,” he added.He said since Nifty had been down by nearly 6% this week so far that it would be prudent for traders to wait for clarity before jumping into a trade, while investors should continue to accumulate fundamental sound stocks on dips. According to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Service, as volatility is expected to be high, traders should remain cautious.

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) on Thursday observed that the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020 passed by Parliament on Wednesday was incompatible with international law and would hamper the work of civil society. “The legislation fails to comply with India’s international legal obligations and constitutional provisions to respect and protect the rights to freedom of association, expression, and freedom of assembly. The ICJ stressed that the Bill’s provisions would impose arbitrary and extraordinary obstacles on the capacity of human rights defenders and other civil society actors to carry out their important work”, an ICJ statement said. Plea to PresidentIt called on the President to withhold his assent due to the “incompatibility of the Bill with international law”. “At a minimum, the ICJ called on the Indian authorities to desist from implementing the provisions of the FCRA 2020 that are inconsistent with international law”, it stated. The FCRA 2020 would restrict access to foreign funding for smaller NGOs and public servants. “It adds onerous governmental oversight, additional regulations and certification processes, and operational requirements, while simultaneously reducing the limit of administrative expenditure that can be allocated to foreign contributions to 20% from the previous 50%,” it said. The statement cited the United Nations Human Rights Council resolution on protecting human rights defenders that said “no law should criminalize or delegitimize activities in defence of human rights on account of the origin of funding”.

 Malayalam literature witnessed a golden moment on Thursday when the Jnanpith Award was handed over to poet Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri at a special function held at his house at Kumaranallur in the district.Minister for Law, Cultural Affairs, Parliamentary Affairs and SC, ST and OBC Welfare A.K. Balan presented the Jnanpith, the country’s highest literary award, to Akkitham. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan inaugurated the function through videoconferencing.Malayalis across the world had celebrated it when Akkitham became the sixth writer to bring Jnanpith Award to Malayalam literature in November last year. The COVID-19 lockdown delayed the award handing over ceremony.Speaking on the occasion, the Chief Minister highlighted the virtuous character of Akkitham, who is widely considered the tallest among the living Malayalam poets.The man who introduced “meaningful modernism” several decades ago in Malayalam poetry, Akkitham is the only living poet being called Mahakavi (great poet) in Malayalam.Akkitham has contributed such seminal works as Pathalathinte Muzhakkam, Irupatham Noottandinte Ithihasam, and Balidarshanam. He has nearly four dozen works to his credit. Among them are anthologies of poems, stories, dramas and essays.He had worked for nearly three decades with Akashvani as scriptwriter and editor. Akkitham had close associations with Communist ideologue E.M.S. Namboodiripad in his early years of career.His work Balidarshanam won the State and Central Sahitya Akademi Awards in 1972-73. He was the co-editor of the Mangalodayam and the Yogakshemam journals. He was awarded Padmashri in 2017. Apart from the Ezhuthachan Award he won in 2008, Akkitham was bestowed with Odakkuzhal Award, Asan Award, Sanjayan Award, Lalithambika Antharjanam Award and several other honours.Critics have praised Akkitham for his powerful imagery that ordinary people could easily associate themselves with. The following lines of Akkitham have travelled deep down the minds of the Malayali:“Velicham dukhamanunnee, thamassallo sughapradam.” Fewer lines in modern Malayalam poetry have gained as much popularity as these.While poet G. Sankara Kurup won the maiden Jnanpith award in 1965, S.K. Poettekkatt brought the laurel to Malayalam after 15 years in 1980. Four years later, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai won the coveted award. M.T. Vasudevan Nair became the fourth Malayali to win the award in 1995. The last Jnanpith reached Kerala in 2007 when O.N.V. Kurup won the laurel. Akkitham won the 55th edition of the Jnanpith.

 Israel on Thursday moved to further tighten its second countrywide lockdown as coronavirus cases continued to soar.The Cabinet voted to close all nonessential businesses, including open-air markets. Prayers and political demonstrations would be limited to open spaces and no more than 20 people, and participants would not be able to travel more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from home for either. The measures are set to go into force on Friday afternoon, as the country shuts down for the weekly Sabbath ahead of Yom Kippur on Sunday and Monday. Israel annually closes down for 24 hours in honor of the solemn holiday.The restrictions are to last for at least two weeks, but synagogues will be allowed to open under restrictive conditions for Yom Kippur prayers. The restrictions on demonstrations are subject to approval by the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, and the limits on both prayers and protests could spark a backlash. An anti-lockdown demonstration was planned for later in the day in front of the Knesset. Israel’s politically influential ultra-Orthodox community has objected to limits on public prayer during the ongoing Jewish High Holidays, and opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have accused the government of using the lockdown as a cover to end weekly demonstrations against his handling of the crisis. Israel is currently reporting nearly 7,000 new daily cases, making the outbreak in the country of 9 million people among the worst in the world on a per capita basis.Israel won praise this spring when it swiftly moved to seal its borders and shut down most businesses. By May, its daily rate of new cases had dropped into the double-digits. But then it reopened the economy too quickly, leading to a surge of new infections over the summer. Many businesses, meanwhile, have yet to recover from the earlier lockdown, and the new restrictions are expected to take a heavy toll on the economy even though they are being imposed during the holidays, when many businesses would ordinarily scale back hours.Israel has reported a total of more than 200,000 cases since the pandemic began, including 1,335 deaths. It has more than 50,000 active cases.

 Hong Kong police arrested prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong on Thursday for participating in an unauthorised assembly in October 2019 and violating the city's anti-mask law, according to a post on his official Twitter account.Mr. Wong's latest arrest adds to several unlawful assembly charges or suspected offences he and other activists are facing related to last year's pro-democracy protests, which prompted Beijing to impose a sweeping national security law on June 30.Hong Kong police confirmed they arrested two men, aged 23 and 74, on Thursday for illegal assembly on Oct 5, 2019.The arrest of Mr. Wong, aged 23, comes around six weeks after media tycoon Jimmy Lai was detained on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces.Mr. Wong had been a frequent visitor to Washington where he appealed to the U.S. Congress to support Hong Kong's democracy movement and counter Beijing's tightening grip over the global financial hub. His visits drew the wrath of Beijing, which says he is a “black hand” of foreign forces.Mr. Wong disbanded his pro-democracy group Demosisto in June, just hours after China's parliament passed national security law for Hong Kong, bypassing the city's local legislature, a move widely criticised by Western governments.His long-time colleague, Agnes Chow, and two other activists were also among 10 people police arrested in August on suspicion of violating the new law.The new law punishes anything China considers as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison.Mr. Wong was just 17 years old when he became the face of the 2014 student-led Umbrella Movement democracy protests, but he was not a leading figure of the often violent unrest that shook the semi-autonomous former British colony last year.An anti-mask law was introduced last year in a bid to help police identify the protesters they suspected of committing crimes and it is facing a challenge in court. In the meantime, the Hong Kong government has made face masks mandatory in most circumstances due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The Tamil Nadu government has permitted students studying in classes 10 to 12 to come to schools on a voluntary basis to seek guidance from their teachers from October 1. This is applicable for government, government-aided and private schools on the condition that the campuses are outside containment zones and students as well as teachers living in containment zones will not be allowed to visit the schools. Schools have been permitted to call 50% of the teachers at a time to provide guidance as well.Schools in the State have remained shut since March, when the national lockdown for COVID-19 was announced. Earlier this month, the Health Ministry had issued guidelines for the partial reopening of schools and had specified that schools were permitted to call students of classes 9 to 12 in case they needed to meet their teachers for guidance.According to the standard operating procedures issued, the students of classes 10 to 12 shall be divided in two batches. The first batch can come to school on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and the other batch on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Only 50% of students in a class will be allowed on any given day to avoid crowding. Teachers too will be required to work in two batches and can work for two days at a stretch, alternatively. This arrangement is subject to obtaining a written consent from the parents or guardians of the students and education through online or distance mode will continue.Physical distancing of at least 6 feet should be followed while making seating arrangements in classrooms and schools are encouraged to use outdoor spaces for conducting teacher-student interactions if the weather permits.Before schools begin to call the students, they have been asked to disinfect their premises thoroughly. School managements have been asked to take responsibility for the upkeep of their premises and school principals should ensure that all persons on campus wear face masks. Thermal screening will have to be done compulsorily for anyone entering the school campus and an appropriate back up of items such as face masks and sanitizers should be kept available at all times.K.R. Nandhakumar, State general secretary. Tamil Nadu nursery, primary, matriculation, higher secondary schools association, said that they welcomed the decision by the government to permit schools to ask senior students to come to the campus. “We will strictly follow the SOPs issued and ensure that physical distancing norms are followed.

 Beverage connoisseurs are always on the lookout for something better. It is in this quest, during the lockdown, that many stumbled upon single estate teas.Though it is not a new type or grade of tea, it had a niche following, until March, when COVID-19, and a string of lockdowns made grocery shopping a challenge. Kausshal Dugarr, founder and CEO of Teabox, a premium tea brand, says that as the popular tea varieties went off the shelf, single-origin tea gained visibility. 







Kausshal explains, “Single estate teas are nothing but leaves that are harvested from one estate. It is not blended and is usually sold under the name of the estate. It focuses on taste and flavour that is mostly dependent on where the estate is.” Single-origin/estate teas are indicators of a specific region that produces specialised tea, and should not be confused with organic teas. “Not all single estate teas are organic,” says Kausshal. “We saw the highest sale of growth of single-estate tea during May-June. It was a surprising eye-opener as the customer profile pointed to a very young crowd. Tea, as a beverage, is bracketed with ‘older people’,” he adds.Tea-o-clock Did you know white tea is known to be the most delicate tea variety? Minimally processed white tea is harvested before the plant’s leaves open fully. The tips selected for this tea should have fine white hair on it, from which it gets its name. They are handpicked and dried with utmost care and are not allowed to oxidise like the leaves for green or black teas.The longer tea leaves are exposed to oxygen; the darker the leaves become, the deeper the flavour profile that is developed. The different processes used to create and control oxidation include rolling, shaping or crushing the leaves to speed up oxidation, and steaming, firing or roasting the leaves to stop it.Ever wondered why tea is prepared and served in a glass or steel pot? That is because glass and steel do not bleach when water is boiled. Meghalaya-based Lakyrsiew single-estate tea grower, Nayantara Sawain, adds, “The sweet, milky chai sold in clay cups on street corners around India remains the staple, but in line with trends abroad, the Indian tea consumer is also becoming more adventurous. The tea trade is responding, albeit slowly, by broadening its offerings. India has all it takes to succeed: the range of quality, distinctive teas made in India’s traditional tea-growing regions of Assam, Darjeeling or The Nilgiris is exceptional. And more and more producers are moving away from low-cost, low-quality mass production and converting to more natural or organic methods while broadening the range of teas they offer. Meanwhile, tea is now grown in new regions like Meghalaya, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram, where it offers unique characteristics of flavour and appearance.”These unique characteristics are the key appeal of such tea, not aspirational branding. Elaborating on what makes single-origin tea different from other premium teas, Nayantara says, “Even when the tea bushes, and the production processes are similar, local climate, soil type and garden altitude can change how the teas taste.” A powerful, malty cup of Assam has very little in common with that pale, grape-scented cup of first-flush Darjeeling, or an amber-golden, cocoa-scented Lakyrsiew second-flush tea despite being made with similar tea leaves. “That local distinctiveness — the French call it ‘terroir’ — can be even more pronounced with single-estate teas. Flavour and appearance of tea vary during the growing season: a bright, almost green first flush tea from Darjeeling or Meghalaya is very different from the darker, fuller-bodied teas made in the same estates during summer. But the discerning tea drinker will always be able to recognise ‘terroir’ in the single-origin teas,” adds Nayantara.The pullAmrit Duggar, tea connoisseur and owner of the tea room Morsel and Tisane in Hyderabad, explains, “Single-estate tea also highlights the skill and craftsmanship of the people that produce the tea. The origin is one of the deciding factors that contribute to its specific flavour.” 







Online shopping for teas show that although single-estate teas come under the ‘gourmet’ or ‘premium’ label, they are not necessarily more expensive than better known blends. (100 grams of Bermiok costs ₹649.) “The process of blending tea itself adds significantly to the cost,” explains Kausshal. As a tea businessman, he makes another point: “To be clear, every tea, whether produced in Assam, The Nilgiris, the Dooars or in Kangra valley, starts as single-origin tea. It will depend on the middleman who decides to include that tea in a blend or to sell it as a single-origin tea.”Kausshal adds that single-estate teas operate similarly. “Generally, they market their best under their label, while any surplus or lower-grade leaves, may be sold to blenders who will sell it under their brand names.”The advantages of single-estate teas are that the drinker learns about (and tastes) the terroir of the estate apart from how it is produced, which offers greater transparency at a time when sustainability and environmental awareness are more important than ever before.

 Skipper Virat Kohli explained how the Yo-Yo test helped Indian cricketers aim for high-level fitness when Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked him about the mandatory running aerobic fitness routine. Prime Minister Modi was interacting with fitness experts and influencers from across the country to mark the one-year anniversary of the ‘Fit India Movement.’ Mr. Modi was keen to know what is Yo-Yo test and asked if the captain also has to pass it or he gets spared? “I heard these days there is a Yo-Yo test for the team, what is this test,” asked Mr. Modi during the virtual interaction.Kohli, smiling, replied, “This Test was very important from fitness point of view. If we talk about global fitness level, our fitness level is still low compared to other teams and we want to take it up, which is a basic requirement.” The gruelling routine has two sets of cones that are 20 metres apart. Once the beep is sounded, the athlete has to reach the marker on the other side by the time the next beep sounds, turn and get back to where he started before the third beep. The frequency of the beeps gradually increases for the subsequent runs. Kohli, who is currently in the UAE for the ongoing 13th IPL, said even he has to clear the test to get selected for the India team.“I’m the one who goes to run first and this is the condition that if I fail that I am also not available for selection. It is important to set that culture and it will lead to improvement in overall fitness levels.” The session was attended by sports persons such as Paralympic javelin gold medallist Devendra Jhajharia and woman footballer from Jammu and Kashmir Afshan Ashiq.  Also present were actor, model and runner Milind Soman and nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar.






Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacts with footballer Afshan Ashiq after launching 'Fit India Age Appropriate Fitness Protocols' during an online Fit India Dialogue, to celebrate the first anniversary of the Fit India Movement, in Srinagar, on September 24, 2020.

Mr. Modi also interacted with Afshan, who hit the headlines in 2017 as a stone pelter in Srinagar.  The 25-year-old played as goalkeeper in J&K women’s football team and later played in the Indian Women’s League in 2019 for FC Kolhapur City. She also trains youngsters in Srinagar. To encourage her Mr. Modi said, “You have done very well in football. Mostly, football fans say ‘Bend it like Beckham’, but now they will say ‘Ace it like Afshan’.” Afshan said she gets inspiration from former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, eulogised as ‘captain cool’.“I do meditation at 5:30 every morning to keep my mind cool. I have learnt a lot from M S Dhoni, he is always calm. I like getting that calmness in my life, it helps to do all work calmly. It helps in balancing mental stress.” Kohli said better fitness has helped the players, especially fast bowlers, to perform during crucial moments.“In Test cricket, sometimes we get tired. Our fast bowlers are best in the world currently and if they have to put that effort on the fourth and fifth day on the field, they can do it now,” he said.“We always had the skills but when in the crucial moment when the body gets tired and the team needs you, our performance used to dip and our opponents used to win, now because of our fitness, we have been able to capitalise and perform on those crucial moments,” he added. Kohli said he didn’t follow the right diet early in his career and stressed on the need to bring an overall change in lifestyle.“When I started playing, I started having lot of things which were not good from health point of view. So physical fitness and diet had to change. Now life is very hectic, so if we don’t keep fitness in sync with our times, we will keep falling behind. If we wouldn’t have focussed on our fitness then we would have fallen behind in our sports as well. We can’t only depend on our skills as mental strength depends on how fit is the body and mind.” Mr. Modi said he was glad that healthy eating is becoming a part of people’s way of living. “Becoming fit is not as difficult as most think. It just requires a little discipline. ‘Fitness ki dose, aadha ghanta roz’ Every Indian should play some game or do some fitness activity, be it tennis, badminton, kabaddi. It has to be for at least half an hour,” the PM said.

The man is seated under a lone neem tree that hangs on precariously to the bund of Coimbatore’s Selvampathy lake. Dressed in a checked blue lungi, he is holding a fishing rod fashioned out of a stick. He may spend hours at that spot for that elusive plump fish that will be his lunch or dinner, depending on when he catches it. Something about his patience, the calm of the environment, and the pristine lake, drew wedding photographer S Buvanesh. He has been visiting the lake for the past few months during lockdown to document such “humble urban hobby fishers”.

“Fishing is usually seen as an expensive hobby,” says the 29-year-old from Ooty, who shifted base to Coimbatore for work. “But the men I am documenting are often from ordinary backgrounds; a lot of them are construction workers who live nearby and cannot afford the fancy equipment needed for hobby fishing,” he adds.They, however, have found other means. “On most occasions, they use sticks to fish with a small ball of satthu maavu (millet health mix) that serves as a bait. Interestingly, it doesn’t dissolve in water,” explains Buvanesh, who has also encountered little boys fishing with just a length of twine. “But their methods work; they mostly always go back home with a good catch that boasts varieties such as catla and rohu,” he adds.

Coimbatore is home to 31 tanks in the Noyyal River basin. Selvampathy is among them. “It is cleaner when compared to the others, and much smaller too,” points out Buvanesh, which is perhaps why locals see it fit for fishing. The men come for fishing at dawn. “They drop off the catch at home and then head for work,” says Buvanesh. This ensures them a meal of fish curry for lunch or dinner.

Over the course of the photo series, he made friends with them and got to see up close the ethics the men practice. “They stay away from fishlings,” he points out. “They have designated spots around the lake and ensure they do not disturb the sanctity of the place by littering. I’ve also come across hobby fishermen who point at empty alcohol bottles around the bund and express regret over how some people use the place to drink.”The series also proved to be a support system for Buvanesh during lockdown. “When some relaxations were announced, I first headed to the lake. After spending several weeks photographing it, I realised I derived peace in its company,” he says. So did the hobby fishers. Buvanesh saw how they were cosily nestled at their usual spots, dreamily eyeing the water.

He hopes to put together a photo documentary on Coimbatore’s wetlands and people’s relationship with them. “The Selvampathy series is part of it,” he explains. The lake is set for a facelift under the Smart City project. “Soon, there will be fences and pavements around it. I wonder what the people who fish there will do then,” he adds.

The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Thursday called for reports from the Housing secretary and Managing Director of Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) over a complaint that alleged that an engineer was threatening residents of Peters Colony to vacate the tenements, that too during the COVID-19 pandemic. SHRC acting chairperson D. Jayachandran called for a detailed report over the issue within five weeks.According to the complaint by T.S. Muthuselvan, Secretary of Peters Colony Residents Welfare Association, TNHB executive engineer (in-charge) Gandhi was threatening residents of the area to vacate so that parts of the tenements could be demolished to give way for a commercial complex. Secretariat staff, government servants, frontline health workers, journalists among others, who were involved in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic were residing in the colony, it said.When over 50 COVID-19 positive cases were reported in the colony, the executive engineer was making phone calls to threaten residents to vacate the tenements and was engaging goondas to force the residents to vacate, the complaint said. The executive engineer was making phone calls to threaten that he would disconnect the electricity and water connections of these tenements if the residents did not vacate soon, it said.It sought for a direction to the government to withdraw from the attempts to evict them and to uphold the guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation and the Indian Council of Medical Research. As their children were studying in schools nearby and undertaking online classes, the residents pleaded not to force them to vacate until the end of 2020-21 academic year.

Google on Wednesday said it is adding a new workday routine to Google Assistant to help users stay productive and fight the blur that can happen while working from home.The voice assist will prompt a user to do normal activities throughout the day, like ‘get up and move,’ ‘go for a walk,’ and ‘grab a glass of water to keep the body up and running.’“This week, we’re rolling out a new workday routine that automatically reminds you of all the small and big things to do throughout your work day—from staying on top of your calendar to taking a break away from the desk—that can sometimes be easy to forget,” Google said in a blog post.After enabling the routine in phone settings, users can start with a pre-set routine. For instance, Monday through Friday at 10:00 a.m., they can set up to get a message from Google Assistant on smart speaker or display saying “it’s time to stand up and stretch!” At 2:00 p.m., it might suggest going for a walk, and then to grab a glass of water at 3:00 p.m.Google also enables its users to customise actions and time blocks to fit into their own schedule. To start with, the feature will be available in English.The search giant is also rolling out Gentle Sleep and Wake feature to all smart lights in the next few days to help a user wind down at night, and wake them up in the morning. In the evening, just say “Hey Google, sleep my lights at 10:00 p.m.” as a reminder to get to bed on time.Similarly, saying “Hey Google, wake my lights at 8:00 a.m.” will prompt lights to fade in and change colour for a wake up. If a user uses Google Assistant alarms already, they just have to say “turn on gentle wake up,” and smart lights will start brightening 30 minutes before the alarm to help resist the urge to hit the snooze button.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K.

 A few days ago, fire personnel in Tambaram slithered down a rope and rescued a 40-year-old man who fell into a well. Since the firefighters have to remain physically and mentally fit to make such rescues, the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) have started obstacle competition for its personnel.The first obstacle competition was conducted in Othivakkam commando training centre. Over 100 personnel took part in the event and they had to cross 19 obstacles spread over 1.3 kilometers.The cut off time was 12 minutes and the personnel had to walk over ladders, jump falls, swing on ropes to finish obstacles events like over bridge, spider net, skyscraper, high-gate vault, kitten crawl and W Wall. “The event disciplines their mind and body. The firemen have to be focussed as the obstacles are slippery and they have to finish on time. This somewhat replicates a real life rescue scenario. It gives them a sense of confidence too. We will be holding such events regularly so that they can carry out rescues with ease,"" said Priya Ravichandran, joint director, TNFRS, Northern Region.The TNFRS Chennai region has made 138 rescues in 2019 and this includes 125 animals. The number is 66 in 2020 till date and out of this 60 are animals. “We have to be extremely fit as most often we carry cows and other animals out of wells. Till now we are used to general fitness workouts, but the obstacle courses build our endurance, concentration and sense of timing,” said TNFRS fire fighter M. Muthukumar, who came first by completing the obstacles in 10.15 minutes.Fire fighter K. Arun Kumar, who completed the event in 10.19 minutes, said that the TNFRS should organise more such events. “We have been given training in swimming and even scuba diving etc. As fire fighters we should be in the best shape ever,” he said.

China on Thursday said there were “enormous divisions” and a lack of consensus on taking forward the stalled reforms of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), a day after the G4 group - India, Brazil, Japan and Germany - called for an early push for text-based negotiations.The foreign ministers of the four countries that are seeking UNSC reforms and permanent membership of the body met virtually on Wednesday, expressing their frustration at the repeated attempts to stall and derail the reforms process.External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said the meeting had “called for a decisive push” and was unanimous in backing “text-based negotiations in a fixed time frame.”India begins a two-year term as one of the 10 non-permanent UNSC members in January, and has said it will continue pushing for reforms that have failed to materialise over many years.Editorial | A new world orderThe G4 group “expressed disappointment at attempts to derail this process and committed to addressing the issue in a meaningful way and with increased urgency at this 75th anniversary of the UN,” a statement said, adding that “without substantive text based negotiations actually taking place in an intergovernmental setting” this process could not go forward.Analysts dismissive of G4Chinese analysts have long been dismissive of the G4, and have in the past indicated that China would not favour the inclusion of at least three of its members for differing reasons - India and Japan considering their historically difficult relations with China, and Germany because it is not a developing country. On Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin suggested that China’s long-held stance that the reforms process cannot go ahead quickly is unlikely to change.“We believe the reforms should increase the representation and voice of developing countries and allow more small and medium size countries to enter the Security Council and participate in the decision making,” Mr. Wang said in response to a question on the G4 statement.“We believe the reform of the Security Council is an important issue which concerns the long term development and all the immediate interests of its members. There have been enormous divisions on this issue and there lacks a widespread consensus on the arrangement for reform,” he said. “China is willing to work with other UN members to seek a package solution that can accommodate all parties’ interests and concerns, through dialogue and negotiation.”

Aequs, the aerospace precision engineering and manufacturing company, on Thursday announced the launch of AQovent, a medical-grade, low-cost, and mass-produced mechanical resuscitator. AQovent is an oxygen-driven emergency resuscitator that can provide constant-flow, pressure-cycled ventilation automatically to patients in respiratory distress. Aequs is manufacturing these resuscitators in its Belagavi facility based on the licence procured on the concept design from the University of Illinois, USA.Today, as the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic, this collaboration with the University of Illinois was initiated to contest one of the main challenges in the current medical system. The challenge is the extensive reliance on a small segment of suppliers for specialised, proprietary, mass-produced resuscitators. This dependence has created a wide gap in the supply-demand model of these specialty products, the company said. Aravind Melligeri, Chairman & CEO, Aequs, said, “At Aequs, we stand in solidarity with the government and medical fraternity in the country’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. AQovent, one of Aequs’ innovations, is a low-cost and indigenously developed resuscitator, operates without a power source, and is hassle-free. The design of AQovent lends itself to a level of scalability, enabling us to ramp up production to meet the surge in demand.” Aequs has leveraged its ‘Aerospace’ and ‘Consumer Divisions' capabilities in its vertically integrated ecosystem at the SEZ in Belagavi to manufacture AQovent.

 Air India Express said Saudi Arabia has permitted outbound passenger flights to India under the Vande Bharat mission. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia had banned flights to and from India amid a surge in coronavirus cases. In a tweet on Wednesday night, Air India Express clarified it would not carry passengers from India to Saudi Arabia.“Air India Express Vande Bharat Mission flights would continue to carry passengers on its flights from Saudi Arabia to India,” it added.  In a circular issued on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia’s General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) said it was “suspending travel to and from the following countries: (India, Brazil and Argentina) including any person who has been in any of the mentioned countries above in the last 14 days prior to their arrival to the Kingdom”. However, it excluded “passengers who have official government invitations”.The GACA circular — titled: ‘Suspension of travel to countries where the COVID-19 virus has outbreak’ — was marked to all the airlines and chartered flight companies operating at the Saudi Arabia’s airports. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) host a significant Indian migrant population. Five days ago, Air India Express said that the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) had suspended its flights for 24 hours for bringing two passengers with COVID-19 positive certificates on August 28 and September 4. Dubai is the most populous city of the UAE. According to rules of the UAE government, every passenger travelling from India is required to bring an original COVID-19 negative certificate of an RT-PCR test done within 96 hours prior to the journey. Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the outbreak. However, special international flights have been operating between India and Saudi Arabia since May 6 under the Vande Bharat mission.

Hope is a feeling that is in short supply these days. The Covid-19 curve only seems to be interested in ascent. The sky has turned a dystopian orange in some parts of the world. Governments say that ‘there is no data’ and use the pandemic to detain those who dare voice dissent. Optimism has been shoved to a corner by fear, distrust and guilt. Our children ask when they can go back to school, when they can see their grandparents, when things will be normal again. And the adults have no answers. We’ve possibly never had the answers, but once upon a time at least we could Google them. It is into this landscape that renowned Irish author-illustrator Oliver Jeffers brings out a new illustrated book, What We’ll Build: Plans for Our Together Future.







Modern familyBuild. Together. Future. Words that connote the very hope that has been relegated to a corner. Jeffers’ latest is dedicated to his two-year-old daughter, Mari. I loved the lyrical quality of his writing and the illustrations that invoked a sense of familiarity. I asked the writer if he’d felt a certain pressure to write a book for Mari, after publishing Here We Are for his son, Harland, in 2017. “It occurred to me that I’d make a book for her before she could speak, so I thought I’d have enough time before she asked for a book,” he says. “I didn’t really know when I’d write a book for her, but as soon as she came along, I found myself in a similar although different situation as I had been when Harland arrived. Without intending to, I started thinking some of these thoughts and writing them down.”And from those thoughts emerged What We’ll Build.







Jeffers says that there’s been a shift in mindset around his own understanding of what a family is, between these two books. “I was grappling with the reality of explaining the world as it is right now to my children. What We’ll Build has a central idea of a partnership between two people looking towards the future together. If Here We Are is about explaining the world as it is, [this book] is about how we change it.”The multi-hyphenate acknowledges that it is definitely more difficult to feel hopeful right now than it has been in the past. And while parents and educators often use his books as a starting point for conversations around grief (The Heart and the Bottle), greed (The Fate of Fausto) and friendship (Imaginary Fred), in his own home, books are very much in the realm of classic storytime. He shares that his children are more interested in spontaneous stories told on the fly and that his partner is much better at the form than he is. 







Shouldering the responsibilityJeffers is one of numerous children’s book creators who offered joy, comfort and pleasure to many during the initial months of the pandemic through his online storytelling session (#StayAtHomeStoryTime). Creators like Mac Barnett, Carson Ellis, and #ThodaReadingCorona sessions in India have been viewed by thousands of children, providing some respite in the otherwise long, seemingly never-ending days, and a break for their caregivers.To me, these thoughtful sessions and their warm reception drove home the point of just how essential creators of children’s literature are in today’s world. And yet, they are rarely given the importance and respect they deserve. Creating books for children is still seen as a hobby, something ‘cute’ one does on the side. 







Jeffers admits that he’d gotten used to hearing such comments himself, and what really made him look at things differently was a conversation with Bono. Yes, the Irish singer-songwriter-philanthropist. He shares an anecdote from a time he was collaborating with U2 and the singer didn’t know who he was. “He asked what I did and I said I write books for kids. I was used to the ‘Oh, that’s sweet’ reaction, but without missing a beat, Bono said, ‘Oh, what a huge responsibility!’ I was like ‘Excuse me?’ and he said, ‘Yeah, you are a human being’s first counterpoint to their cultural world. That’s a huge responsibility’.”If he feels the weight of that responsibility, Jeffers doesn’t show it in his new book. It has the lightness, beauty and deft touch of humour that we have come to look forward to in his work.My favourite lines from the book are:A place to stay when all is lost, to keep the things we love the most.We’ll put these favourite things beside, the earlier love we set aside.I think that we may want them laterWhen times are hard and needs are greater.Those hard times are now. And What We’ll Build is just the book we need for it.Published by HarperCollins, What We’ll Build is scheduled to be released on October 25. At ₹799, it is available for pre-order.

On Wednesday, the rupee appreciated by one paisa to settle at 73.57 against the US dollar. During the session, the local unit witnessed an intra-day high of 73.75 and a low of 73.96 against the greenback.

IAS officer TN Venkatesh, 44, has been wearing colourful ikat and handloom shirts to work for some years now. It isn't unusual to find his colleagues sporting them too. The outgoing MD of Co-optex, the Tamil Nadu Handloom Weavers’ Co-operative Society Ltd (established in 1935), has always liked to lead by example. “My wardrobe changed. Barely 30% of it comprises formal shirts now,” he admits.Early influencesAs a child, Venkatesh was surrounded by experiences that defined his love for fabrics. He remembers his mother wearing Devendra and Madurai sungudi saris, and the many textile mills he saw in Maharashtra (his father worked in the Department of Posts). In Bombay, he accompanied his mother and aunt on their sari shopping trips to Dadar and Chembur. “I noticed floral and Mughal motifs that I would recreate on paper, the screen prints of Garden Vareli... that is where I developed a fascination for textiles. I wanted to know how these fabrics were made,” says Venkatesh, who also visited Solapur and Paithan with his father, where they saw paithani being woven.At 16, he moved to Delhi, and explored the emporia on Baba Kharak Singh Marg. “During our holidays, we would travel to the East and my mother would pick out Bengal cottons from Gariahat. I decided that when it was time to work, I would like to deal with such weaves,” he recalls.

Textile trails down SouthAnd so, after stints as Pollachi sub-collector (2003-2005), Karur collector (2007-2009), and at the Department of Education and Commercial Taxes, he came to Co-optex in 2014. “It was a godsend. Pollachi and Karur opened my eyes to the possibilities of the state’s textile traditions,” he says.It gave him the opportunity to work with the weavers of Negamam. “It was the first time I visited a weaver’s house. When I tried operating the loom, I realised how hard one had to press the pedal. And they did it continuously for days. It is such a tough process, but something they’ve kept at, handing it down from generation to generation,” he says, adding, “Rarely do you see outsiders take to weaving. It is actually impossible for someone who has never been part of the pre and post-weaving process to suddenly learn how to weave.”In Karur, he realised handloom did not mean just saris; possibilities included bed linen and home furnishing. “I learnt the difference between powerloom and shuttleloom, and why handloom still retains an aesthetic value.”At Co-optex, he began by touring weaving clusters within the state and outside. “I developed great respect for weavers who translated motifs on to fabric. I’ve visited 25 clusters in the country so far, because the best education is spending time with the artisans.” In fact, Venkatesh focussed on bringing changes in loom design technique and design intervention. The result shows in the new colour and design palette of Co-optex.

In his personal capacity, he organised textile trails with handloom enthusiasts. “All I had to do was leverage the one thing Co-optex had in abundance: customer trust. The colourful butterfly logo is symbolic of the vibrant weaves of the state and our fairtrade policy.”Designers from outside Tamil Nadu have always spoken with reverence for the state’s weavers’ ecosystem, he says. “Here, a predominant part of weaving is within the co-operative fold. Tamil Nadu supports close to 70,000 people in the weaving and pre-and post-weaving process. Sales can be seasonal, but work is perennial. The cooperative takes the risk of procuring and stocking stuff. I might buy a jamakkalam (floor mat) from Bhavani this year and sell it only next year. But the weaver is taken care of.” In Co-optex, 40% of a product’s cost goes to the weaver. This is also said to be the reason why there were few distress calls during the lockdown from Tamil Nadu’s weavers.Being sustainableAmong the things Venkatesh is happy about during his tenure is that he instilled in his colleagues a deep pride for the brand. “We expanded their knowledge base. From Thirubuvanam and Koorainadu to Dindigul and Paramakudi, they can now identify weaves.” He also conducted knowledge-enhancement sessions for customers across cities, speaking about textiles and motifs, followed by a sale. The last stop before the lockdown was in Bhubaneswar. “We would do sales of up to ₹11 lakh. My colleagues saw that engaging with people helped. It was a trickle-down effect,” he says.During his tenure, Co-optex also introduced organic cotton saris, and priced them below ₹5,000. But the transition took time. “In 2015, weavers at Vadambacheri near Sulur, Coimbatore, agreed to do the first batch of 10 organic cotton saris after we spent two days convincing them. It did so well, we developed similar clusters in Salem, Paramakudi and Dindigul.”He also gives the example of Nangal Nagar in Dindigul as proof of positive intervention. “In 2015, the weavers were doing art silk [bumper cotton] and sales had dwindled because powerloom replicas were selling at a fourth of the cost. This cluster of 130 weavers transitioned to mercerised cotton. From two-three saris a month, a couple can now make about 20 saris in the same period. Their income levels have shot up 2.5 times. When you systematically work on a product and market it well, you will reap benefits.”

From the bottom upUnder the state’s Handloom Support Programme, weavers have been trained in skill upgradation. Venkatesh says he believes in a system that “evolves from below”. “The main stakeholders — the weavers and designers — were involved in decision making. We modernised 50 showrooms in the last six years, and the improved ambience has made a difference,” he says. For instance, the Thillaiyadi Valliammai showroom in Egmore has seen annual sales go up from ₹4.62 crore in 2017 to ₹7.85 crore in 2019. In 2018, work began to renovate the showroom and its facade was changed using aluminium casting and fibre board to reflect what was being sold inside. “We changed the elevation to represent a floral jacquard weave and the shuttles used in weaving. This was our premium store and I wanted a different aesthetic for it,” says Venkatesh.He also harnessed social media; the Co-optex page on Instagram has over 25,000 followers now. Most recently, he conceptualised the Handloom Cafe in Egmore, featuring handloom motifs and artefacts, and serving simple food and good coffee. “Once colleges open, I hope more youngsters visit. Even now, we sell about three saris at the cafe every day,” he says.As Venkatesh steps down from a successful stint, he is grateful for the opportunity to have experienced up close a field that first charmed him as a child. And that while Co-optex is known for its bedsheets and towels, people are now aware that “it also makes brilliant saris”.

From 500 cases to 57 lakh. Six months after a nationwide lockdown, COVID-19 is spreading fast across the length and breadth of India with more testing and developments on the vaccine front but no clarity on when the disease will be controlled, say scientists.On March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day lockdown for the entire country, stating it was the only way to break the chain of infection. At the time, the number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus was a little over 500 and the death toll 12.Six months on, India has the second highest number of cases in the world after the US with a tally of 57.32 lakh cases, 86,508 people testing positive in a day and a total of 91,149 fatalities, according to Union Health Ministry figures on Thursday.As COVID-19 rages -- and even laypersons get conversant with the complexities of RT-PCR tests versus the cheaper but not so reliable rapid antigen tests -- US-based economist and epidemiologist Ramanan Laxminarayan said there is a hidden epidemic happening even as the pandemic spreads.He noted that the infection is spreading widely across all parts of the country, including into rural India, although the visibility is lower in places where testing is weak or inadequate.We will likely see some increases in states like UP and Bihar but only if RT-PCR testing increases. Right now, we have a hidden epidemic in many parts of the country which have weak health systems, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in Washington told PTI.While the infection is spreading at a slower rate than if people were not taking precautions, it is definitely not under control, Laxminarayan added.However, he expects the number of cases to start coming down in the next month or two as India approaches some sense of population immunity. As a substantial number of the population is infected and recovers from the disease, they are unlikely to spread the virus.Given the precautions that are being taken both by the government and individuals, the epidemic has slowed down. This would mean that we would see a sustained plateau for a while before the cases start coming down, Laxminarayan said.

 On March 23, a day before the prime minister announced the lockdown and two days before it came into force, India had tested 18,383 samples. Till September 22, this had gone up to at least 6,62,79,462 tests, both RT-PCR and rapid antigen.The recoveries have gone up to over 46 lakh people, pushing the national recovery rate to 81.55 per cent.Immunologist Satyajit Rath sounded a note of caution and said India is still at the stage of spreading viral infection across communities.With global, international travel as the point of origin, the infection was first established in urban high-density localities, and is now spreading from those into the rest of the country, at widely varied speeds, Rath, from the National Institute of Immunology (NII) in New Delhi, told PTI.The infection has never really been under control in India, he said.The early harsh prolonged lockdown somewhat delayed the large-scale establishment of the infection. But ‘control’ has never been a possibility. So we are certainly going to see growth in the infection numbers for quite a long while yet, Rath added.Immunologist Vineeta Bal concurred with Rath, saying the Indian government did not learn much despite experiences from other parts of the world and announced complete draconian lockdowns that were extended for long periods.Leadership in the country lacked in its vision and could not get a sense of the ground realities for poor people; or maybe did not care, Bal, from Pune’s Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research, told PTI.

 Because of major undermining of public health infrastructure for decades, our epidemic handling preparedness was very, very poor. That could have been the only justifiable reason for imposing the lockdown, Bal added.Laxminarayan took a different view. He said there were many positives about the control strategy, including an early recognition of the threat faced by India, and an early lockdown though the implementation and planning could have been much better. The lack of early testing really cost the country. With better and more expanded testing early on, that India was fully capable of, the lockdown could have been more targeted rather than been nationwide. Since then, there has been much confusion on the scientific communication, including on the prospects for a vaccine and the utility of hydrochloroquine. The performance across different states has been very varied depending on their health system capacity, he noted.Rath said the early harsh prolonged lockdown created more problems than it solved.It somewhat delayed the large-scale establishment of the infection, but it did that at the disproportionately massive cost of disruption of already fragile livelihoods, of the economy, and of healthcare systems, he explained.Bal also pointed out that India has been paying for its long-term neglect of healthcare infrastructure that should accessible to the poor and the needy.While there have been serious efforts to build infrastructure, upgrade facilities in the past six months, what has been done is still not enough, she added.Discussing the vaccine, on which rest the hopes of billions of people globally, the experts said there are almost 200 efforts across the world to build and test candidates. A large number, growing by the week, are in clinical trials of actual efficacy.

 In India, there are at least eight vaccine candidates being developed, two of which have entered Phase 2 trials or the penultimate stage.In all likelihood, a number of vaccines will emerge. Optimistically, the first vaccines will probably be licensed by the end of this calendar year, Rath said. Further, the first-generation vaccines are likely to provide significant but not complete protection, and it will not be clear how long protection will last and how well booster vaccination will work, he said.Laxminarayan, also an affiliate professor at the University of Washington, added that it is too early to know if any of the vaccine candidates under development in India will play a major role in COVID-19 control in the country. However, one should hope that, he said.This is the first disease in human history, to the best of my knowledge, where candidate vaccine trials began in less than eight-nine months from the day the virus was identified and its sequence published. This is a major technological achievement, Bal added.The expert noted that in India the pandemic is unlikely to be over in the months to come, and the number of people getting infected will continue to rise.

  Reacting to the recent chargesheet filed against several political leaders and activists in connection with anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests, the Communist Party of India on Thursday said that the Delhi Police was trying to frame anyone critical of the Narendra Modi government. In a statement, the party said that the peaceful and democratic protests against the CAA were a legitimate, constitutional expression of people’s dissent against the law. “It was the effectiveness of the protests that shook the BJP, which is now attempting to portray the protests as a conspiracy to cause riots in North-East Delhi. It is indeed shocking that the Delhi Police is trying to frame political leaders and activists who are critics of the anti-people policies and programmes of the current regime,” the party said.

Earlier, CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury was named. “All these people extended solidarity with the peaceful protests led by Muslim women and now this is being twisted into a grand conspiracy. In contrast, the glaring absence in the chargesheets on the role of leaders associated with the BJP, who gave inflammatory speeches, is unmissable,” the statement said.

The pandemic-induced challenges failed to deter engineering aspirants in the State with more students qualifying for the B.Tech admissions this year. The results of the KEAM 2020 entrance examinations, which were declared by Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel on Thursday, saw 53,236 candidates securing eligibility for admissions, marking a significant increase of 7,639 compared to last year.Boys outshone girls this year too by securing the top 9 ranks and 87 out of the top-100 ranks in the engineering entrance examination. The trend was in contrast with the pharmacy entrance results that were also announced with 58 girls figuring in the top-100 ranks, despite boys bagging seven out of the top-10 ranks.Varun K.S. of Kottayam bagged the top position in the engineering entrance examination by securing a score of 593.6776.

The BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel said here on Thursday that Minister of State for Railways Suresh Channabasappa Angadi who passed away in Delhi on Wednesday was a simple and child-hearted man. Speaking at a condolence meeting in the party's district office Mr. Kateel, also the Member of Parliament from Dakshina Kannada, said that Mr. Angadi had built educational institutions in North Karnataka. He did not compromise with the principles and discipline of the BJP and worked in a Lok Sabha constituency which posed many challenges. He took both Marathi and Kannada speaking people into confidence and was capable of convincing both the groups whenever there was trouble over the language and other issues. Hence he could win from Belagavi constituency four times. As a Minister for State for Railways he made significant contributions to Karnataka by sanctioning various trains and projects. He was a hard worker and instrumental in building the BJP in North Karnataka. The late Minister never lost his temper at any time and was a kind-hearted man.

 Award-winning actor Neena Gupta is slated to come out with a no-holds-barred account of her personal and professional life in 2021, announced publishing house Penguin Random House India on Thursday. The memoir, Sach Kahun Toh, will chronicle her life — from her childhood in Delhi’s Karol Bagh, and her time at the National School of Drama, to her move to Bombay in the 1980s, as well as her struggles to find work. It will be published under Penguin ‘Ebury Press’ imprint, they added. A National Award winner with a career spanning more than 35 years, Gupta made her mark in films like Trikal, Mandi and Utsav in the 80s. She rose to further acclaim with the 1998 TV shows Saans and Siski but work eventually slowed down in the 2000s, before she bounced back with hits like Anubhav Sinha’s Mulk and Amit Sharma’s Badhaai Ho in 2018. Gupta, 61, said it was her time spent in Mukteshwar in Uttarakhand recently during the coronavirus-induced lockdown that made her “reflect” and “relive” her life’s journey. “Taking long, winding walks every day, appreciating the sounds of the birds and basking in the chill of the mountain air, I asked myself, ‘Why should I write a book? What do I have to say that could help and inspire someone?’,” she said.“With so many incidents that have made me and also broken me, and I needed to free myself by getting them out. Reflecting about my life, my journey and the things I’ve had to overcome will make me feel better and lighter,” said the actor. She added that through her book she wanted her readers to know that if despite her flaws, her broken relationships and circumstances in her life, “she can get up, get going and look really good while doing so”, so can they. According to the publishers, the book promises to be “a candid, self-deprecating portrait of the person behind the persona”, while talking about “her unconventional pregnancy and single parenthood”, as well as her “successful second innings in Bollywood”. Gupta and West Indian cricketer Vivian Richards, who were in a brief relationship in the 80s, are parents to celebrated fashion designer Masaba Gupta. Gupta raised Masaba as a single mother for a long time before marrying Delhi-based chartered accountant Vivek Mehra in 2008. “Neena Gupta is a treasure and I’ve been a huge fan of her work, her wit and repartee over the years. On social media, she drops truth bombs with perfect poise—whether it be her views on motherhood, the norms of ‘unladylike’ behaviour, or an out-of-work actor seeking roles! The best memoirs are as unsparingly honest as this and I’m so happy that Penguin will be publishing,” said Gurveen Chadha, senior commissioning editor, Penguin Random House India.

The Supreme Court on Thursday asked activist and lawyer Sudha Bharadwaj, who is languishing in jail for two years in the Bhima Koregaon case, why she is seeking bail on medical grounds when she has “such a good case on merits”.“Why is your client not applying for bail on merits”, Justice U.U. Lalit asked advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for Ms. Bharadwaj.“You have such a good case on merits, why are you seeking bail on medical grounds”, Justice Ajay Rastogi also asked Ms. Grover.Ms. Bharadwaj agreed to withdraw the current plea for bail on medical conditions. She had sought bail, expressing concern about her heart disease. Ms. Grover described the heart condition as a “ticking time bomb”. She submitted that her client’s co-morbidities also made her prone to COVID-19 infection.But Justice Lalit asked Ms. Grover to explain more about the case against her client.To this, Ms. Grover drew a detailed picture of how her client has been a noted lawyer, globally recognised for her work. She has taught at the National Law University, Delhi.“They [prosecution agencies] claimed there is a criminal conspiracy, but nothing has been recovered from me. Charges have not been framed. Two years are over. My father passed away in the meantime... I have never abused the process of law... I need bail to get myself diagnosed medically”, Ms. Grover explained her client's predicament.It was at this point both judges wondered why Ms. Bharadwaj had not applied for bail on the merits of her case alone. They, however, said they cannot grant bail on medical grounds.‘Encouraged by court observations’Withdrawing the bail plea, Ms. Grover said she was encouraged by the observations made by the apex court about her client’s chances to get bail on merits itself.The Bombay High Court had rejected bail to Ms. Bharadwaj on medical grounds in August.Earlier, the Special Court in Mumbai had denied her bail on the objection of the National Investigation Agency.Ms. Bharadwaj was arrested in 2018 and initially lodged at the Yerwada Jail. She has remained incarcerated in the Byculla jail on charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

 Nearly 74% of the new COVID-19 recoveries are from 10 states and UT, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, UP, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Delhi, Kerala, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, the Union Health Ministry said on Thursday.Daily new recoveries in India have surpassed the new cases of coronavirus infection for the the last six days and the country’s total COVID-19 recoveries have surged to 46.7 lakh exceeding active cases by more than 37 lakh. A total 87,374 people have recuperated in a span of 24 hours in the country, while the number of new confirmed cases reported is 86,508, according to the data updated at 8 am.Also read | Coronavirus India lockdown Day 182 updates With its focussed strategies and effective people-centric measures, India is reporting exponential increase in recoveries, the ministry said.“New recoveries in India have exceeded the new cases for the last six days. This is a result of focus on testing, tracing, treatment, surveillance and clear messaging, as highlighted by the prime minister in his review meeting with seven high focus states and UTs on Wednesday,” the ministry said. A total 87,374 people have recuperated in a span of 24 hours taking the total number of recoveries to 46,74,987 pushing the recovery rate to 81.55%, the ministry said.“As India records more recoveries than the new cases, the gap between recovered cases and active cases is continuously widening.

 A daily wager in Odisha’s Kandhamal district has moved the Lok Adalat against Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he allegedly failed to get an Aadhaar card registered in his name despite 21 attempts. Jitendra Kumar Sethy, a resident of Khetapaju village in Khajuripada block, took the unusual step for redressal of his grievance as he ran out of patience after applying and getting photographed multiple times at different places for the elusive card. In a one-page petition filed before the permanent Lok Adalat in Phulbani, district headquarters of Kandhamal district, Mr. Sethy pointed out that he was not issued the card due to technical glitches in taking his fingerprint. At the adalat, the man submitted identity proofs such as his voter identity card, job card issued under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and bank pass book. “I am not able to access different government welfare schemes. I am being turned away by government offices as I don’t have an Aadhaar card,” said Mr. Sethy, who lives with three minor children, wife and ageing parents. No other family members of his faced any issue for getting an Aadhaar card registered in their names. “My photographs were taken 21 times. First, I stood in a queue at Khajuripada tahasil office. Later, I waited for five to six months. My father received his Aadhaar number, while my application was shown as rejected. Subsequently, I enrolled for an Aadhaar card at our Balaskumpa Panchayat office. It was again rejected,” he narrated. Mr. Sethy was asked to register and get photographed several times in Phulbani. The man claimed to have met District Collectors more than once. Despite assurances by district authorities, he failed to secure the Aadhaar card each time. “I was instructed to go to Bhubaneswar to enquire the reason behind repeated rejections. Being a daily-wage earner, I cannot afford to visit the capital city,” he said. “Then, my well-wishers advised me to file a case in the Lok Adalat as I need not have to spend anything for fighting my case. I decided to sue the Prime Minister as he is the one who is responsible for the implementation of Aadhaar,” Mr. Sethy said, adding that he was awaiting a response since filing the case at the Lok Adalat on March 16.

Global labour income is estimated to have declined by 10.7% or $3.5 trillion in the first three quarters of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said on Wednesday.“The devastating losses in working hours caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have brought a ‘massive’ drop in labour income for workers around the world,” the ILO said in its latest assessment of the effects of the pandemic on the world of work.Also Read | Labour Ministry notifies draft on minimum wagesGlobal labour income is estimated to have declined by 10.7% or $3.5 trillion in the first three quarters of 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This figure excludes the income support provided through government measures. The ILO said the biggest drop was in the lower-middle income countries, where the labour income losses reached 15.1%, with the Americas being the hardest hit region at 12.1%. The ILO Monitor: COVID-19 and the world of work sixth edition also estimates that global working hour losses in the first nine months of 2020 have been “considerably larger” than previously estimated. The revised estimate of the global working time lost in the second quarter of this year (compared to Q4 2019) is for 17.3%, equivalent to 495 million full time equivalent (FTE) jobs. The working-hour losses are expected to remain high in the third quarter of 2020, at 12.1% or 345 million FTE jobs.Also Read | Formalisation of labour critical for wages, social security: ISFThe outlook for Q4 has worsened significantly since the last ILO Monitor was issued. Under the ILO’s baseline scenario, global working-hour losses are now projected to amount to 8.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020 (compared to Q4 2019), which corresponds to 245 million FTE jobs. This is an increase from the ILO’s previous estimate of 4.9% or 140 million FTE jobs.The ILO said a reason for the estimated increases in working-hour losses is that workers in developing and emerging economies, especially those in informal employment, have been much more affected than by past crises. It also notes that the drop in employment is more attributable to inactivity than unemployment, with important policy implications. “While many stringent workplace closures have been relaxed, there are significant variations between regions. 94% of workers are still in countries with some sort of workplace restrictions and 32% are in countries with closures for all but essential workplaces,” the agency said.Also Read | Lockdown wages: Supreme Court allows firms to negotiate with staffWorkers in developing nations had also seen their income drop by more than 15%, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder told journalists in Geneva. “On top of this, these are the places where there are the weakest social protection systems, so there are very few resources or protections for working people to fall back upon,” he said. “If you look at it regionally, the Americas were worst-affected, with losses of 12.1%.” Mr. Ryder said while the governments of richer countries had shored up their economies with hundreds of billions of dollars, poorer nations had been unable to do the same. Without such fiscal stimulus, working hours losses would have been 28% between April and June, instead of 17.3%, he added.Also Read | Boost wages to stimulate India’s growth In order for developing countries to reach the same ratio of stimulus to working hours lost as in high-income countries, they would need to inject a further $982 billion ($45 billion in low-income countries and $937 billion in lower-middle income countries). The stimulus gap for low-income countries amounts to less than one percent of the total value of the fiscal stimulus packages announced by high-income countries.This huge “fiscal stimulus gap” is even more worrying in the light of the social protection deficits in many developing countries. Moreover, some of these countries have also had to redirect public spending from other objectives in order to mitigate the labour market impact of the crisis, the ILO said.“Just as we need to redouble our efforts to beat the virus, so we need to act urgently and at scale to overcome its economic, social and employment impacts. That includes sustaining support for jobs, businesses and incomes,” Mr. Ryder said.Also Read | About 400 million workers in India may sink into poverty: UN report“As the United Nations General Assembly gathers in New York, there is a pressing need for the international community to set out a global strategy for recovery through dialogue, cooperation and solidarity.

In a statement, he pointed out the announcement made by Karnataka government in the Assembly that it would direct industries to hire Kannadigas in jobs requiring mechanics, clerks, accountants, supervisors and also give preference to locals in management level positions. “I welcome the announcement made by Karnataka and its strategy to protect jobs for locals should be adopted by other States.

A small study of 1,140 pregnant women in Maharashtra found that 141 women were infected with novel coronavirus , translating to 12.3%.Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health MinistryThe study by researchers from the Mumbai-based ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health (NIRRH) also found that nearly one in 10 pregnant women did not show any symptoms of coronavirus infection at the time of presenting in a hospital.The prevalence of infection among pregnant women was based on data collected between April 25 and May 20 from 15 hospitals in the State where pregnant women presented at the time of labour or who were likely to deliver in the next five days.Watch | COVID-19: Dos and don'ts from the Health MinistryWhen the researchers pooled the data of 141 pregnant women with 180 women from Nair Hospital in Mumbai, which exclusively caters to COVID-19 patients, they found that only 11.5% of pregnant women who were infected with the virus showed symptoms, while the remaining 88.5% were asymptomatic.“Pregnant women generally have low immunity and are at increased risk of getting infected. It is therefore important to test pregnant women for coronavirus infection,” says Dr. Deepak Modi from NIRRH and one of the authors of the study published in the journal European Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Reproductive Biology. “Low immunity does not mean they would automatically show symptoms when infected.”Also read: Coronavirus | States should take the call on local lockdowns, says PM Modi“Pregnancy is to some extent an immunocompromised state to protect the fetus. So yes, pregnant women are always at higher risk for infections, just like people on immunosuppression therapy (eg recovering cancer patients) and those with an immunodeficiency,” says virologist Dr. Shahid Jameel, CEO of DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance says in email to The Hindu.“The proportion of symptomatic to asymptomatic individuals varied greatly across the different cities. Our results estimate the presence of one symptomatic to every nine asymptomatic pregnant women,” they write.Can the prevalence of coronavirus infection among pregnant women can be extrapolated to the general community? “No, I don't think you can do that unless the sample size is very large. The other problem is that there are gender differences for infection and disease, and you would completely miss that out by looking only at women. For example, COVID-19 appears to have worse outcomes in men vs women. We don’t know whether men and women have different susceptibility to infection,” says Dr. Jameel.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had recommended universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women, as infected women, including those who do not show symptoms, can infect the newborns and also pose a risk to health-care workers attending on them.“This study has shown the importance of universal testing of pregnant women. Only this helped identify pregnant women who did not show symptoms,” says Dr Rahul Gajbhiye from NIRRH and a co-author of the paper. “Detecting asymptomatic pregnant women helped prevent the spread of the virus to newborns, health-care workers and others in the community.”

The Rajasthan High Court has stayed arrest warrants issued against former Union Minister Arun Shourie and another accused in a case registered over the disinvestment of India Tourism Development Corporation-owned Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel in Udaipur in 2002.A special court had last week asked the CBI to file cases against Mr. Shourie and four others in connection with the hotel's sale.Justice Dinesh Mehta at the High Court's principal seat in Jodhpur directed Mr. Shourie to appear before the trial court on any day by October 15 and furnish a personal bail bond of ₹2 lakh and two sureties of ₹1 lakh each. The court also granted interim relief from arrest to the other accused, who was the disinvested hotel's valuer, and asked him to appear in the trial court on October 8.The hotel was sold for ₹7.52 crore when Mr. Shourie was the Minister in-charge of disinvestment in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre. During a preliminary investigation by the CBI, the property was valued at ₹252 crore, suggesting a loss of ₹244 crore to the exchequer.The High Court had on Tuesday granted interim relief to three other persons over arrest warrants issued by the special court, which had rejected the final closure report filed by the CBI. The CBI told the High Court that no irregularity was committed in filing the report, while the Centre's Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju contended that the trial court's order was not in conformity with law.Mr. Shourie's counsel, Prashant Bhushan, said through video-conferencing that the special court had erred in passing the order to issue arrest warrant, as there was no urgency to summon him, especially because he was not even named in the first information report.Mr. Shourie also sought exemption from appearance in person for furnishing the bond and sureties, while citing his age and ill-health.

Hong Kong’s professional journalism association on Thursday protested new rules restricting who can provide press coverage during demonstrations, saying the government has no right to determine who is or isn’t a reporter.The rules outlined in a Tuesday letter from police have been criticized as a further erosion of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory’s once robust press freedoms since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in June that has had a chilling effect on political speech.Also Read | U.N. experts raise concerns over Hong Kong security lawOnly journalists registered with the Government News and Media Information Service or members of “internationally recognized and reputable” foreign media outlets will be recognized as journalists during protests, according to the police letter.That appears to undercut the authority of the Hong Kong Journalists Association and Hong Kong Press Photographers Association to vet candidates for membership and issue press cards, placing that right solely in the hands of government officials, as is the case in mainland China.“Police cannot be permitted to use administrative means to screen only officially recognized media, thus undermining the fundamental rights of the people of Hong Kong,” the Hong Kong Journalists Association said in a statement.In their letter, the police said their goal is to weed out troublemakers posing as journalists who they say disrupted police action against protesters over several months of sometimes violent anti-government demonstrations.Also Read | Hong Kong police arrest 289 at protests over election delay“Following the amendment, the definition of ‘media representatives’ will become clearer and unequivocal, allowing front-line officers to efficiently and swiftly verify the identity of media representatives so that facilitation can be provided without compromising police operational efficiency,” the police letter said.The regulations leave it to the police to determine what media outlets are “internationally recognized and reputable” and could discriminate against freelancers and independent and student journalists, who often work alone with minimal equipment and infrastructure.Hong Kong has dropped steadily in Reporters Without Borders annual World Press Freedom Index, falling seven places this year to 80.Hong Kong’s press freedom “is already in retreat as a result of pressure from Beijing,” the group said, citing among cases the expulsion of Financial Times Asia editor Victor Mallet in October 2018 after he chaired an even at the Foreign Correspondents’’ Club of Hong Kong that was condemned by Beijing.

Taking note of the fact that it has been over nine years since a board of trustees was constituted for the Palani Dhandayuthapani Swami Temple, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has asked the State government to take possible steps to constitute the same as early as possible.Justice G.R. Swaminathan took into account the fact that since 2011, the Executive Officer/ Fit Person was at the helm of the affairs and even after nine years, the authorities had not constituted a board of trustees to manage the affairs of the temple. It can only be characterised as subversion of the statutory scheme.The court was hearing the petition filed by T.R. Ramesh who challenged the tender notification issued inviting tenders for providing house keeping services in the temple and institutions attached to it. The petitioner contended that devotees were entitled to offer voluntary service known as ‘uzhavara pani.’Further, the petitioner contended that by entrusting maintenance and cleaning works to outsiders in the name of housekeeping contract, the temple management had infringed on the rights of devotees. He said that no regular board was constituted for over nine years and the Executive Officer cannot take major decisions having financial implications.Quashing the tender notification, the court observed that in the very nature of things, decisions in matters that involve financial implications will have to be taken only by a duly constituted trust board. Policy decisions can only be taken by a duly constituted board of trustees, the court said. When the same official combines in himself both the offices of Executive Officer and Fit Person, the mechanism of checks and balances goes. Executive Officers are appointed so that trustees do not run amok. But if he is also made the fit person to discharge the functions of a trustee and continues for years, it is a fraud on the statute, the judge said.Further, the judge said that Article 25 of the Constitution confers the fundamental right to freely practise one’s religion. In the case of Hindus, it would include the right to perform uzhavara pani. The temple management can of course regulate it, but cannot deny it, the court said.

Several farmers in parts of Punjab on Thursday started a three-day ‘rail roko’ agitation under the banner of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Samiti against the Union government’s three agriculture sector Bills.The railways suspended several trains completely or partially till September 26 for the safety of passengers and protection of railway property.Members of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), who had extended support to the agitation, blocked railway track in Sangrur and Barnala, while members of the Samiti blocked the track in Amritsar and Ferozpur.“We have blocked the railway track at Devidaspura in Amritsar and Basti Tanka wala in Ferozepur. The ‘rail roko’ will continue till September 26 in the first phase. And if our demands are not met with, we will intensify the agitation. We will also support the ‘Bharat bandh’ call given by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC),” said Sarvan Singh Pandher, State president of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Samiti.“While we appeal to people across the country to support our cause, we have decided that representatives of political parties will not be allowed to share the stage in our agitation. Other farmers’ unions have also extended support to our agitation,” he stated.

‘Ill-conceived move’Terming the Bills an ill-conceived move on the Centre’s part, Mr. Singh observed that the new legislations were completely anti-farmer and their implementation would ultimately lead to farmers’ exploitation at the hands of big corporate houses. “It will also lead to the end of the Minimum Support Price regime,” he added.As protests against the Bills continue, 31 farmers’ outfits based in Punjab have given a call for a complete shutdown across the State on September 25. Over 250 farmer and farm-worker organisations, under the umbrella of the AIKSCC, had given a call for ‘Bharat bandh’ the same day.Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bhartaiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said all the 31 farmer outfits have decided to to stop railway traffic indefinitely from October 1, if their demands were not fulfilled.“Also, we will socially boycott - MPs and MLAs, who are in favour of the farm Bills.

 A civil society group in Nepal has launched protests against China for allegedly constructing buildings on the country’s territory in Humla district, according to media reports on Wednesday. The activists chanted slogans such as “Return Nepal’s land” and “stop Chinese expansionism,” it said. According to The Kathmandu Post, China has allegedly constructed 11 buildings on the Nepalese territory in the Humla district bordering Tibet. The disputed area lies in Lampcha village of Namkha Rural Municipality in Humla district. Beijing has maintained that the constructions were carried out on the Chinese side of the border. The reports also said that Pillar Number 11 that defined the Nepal-China boundary was missing from the area.“There was just a hut in the area in 2005,” Dattaraj Hamal, assistant chief district officer of Humla who visited the disputed area recently, was quoted as saying by The Kathmandu Post.“I talked to the people there and reported to the chief district officer, Mr. Hamal said. “He in turn reported to the Home Ministry. He now has gone to the area as per the Home Ministry’s instructions.” Chakka Bahadur Lama, a Member of Parliament from Humla, said that as long as both sides do not ascertain the location of the missing pillar, the dispute will continue. On Tuesday, a Nepalese delegation led by Chief District Officer of Humla had reached the area to talk to Chinese officials, My Republica reported. However, the Chinese security personnel had returned them saying that the land falls on the Chinese side of the border, the paper added. During a meeting between the two sides in 2015, Nepal and China had agreed to ascertain the location of the missing pillar, but no steps were taken on the matter, the paper said, citing Paljor Tamang, chair of Ward No 6 of the rural municipality where the disputed area lies. Meanwhile, the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu refuted the allegations and said the buildings were constructed on the Chinese side of the border.“The government of China has conducted necessary investigation into the matter and the Nepal government can also do so if needed,” said a statement issued by the embassy.“China and Nepal have no territorial disputes. The two sides have always maintained close communication on border affairs,” the statement said. “China and Nepal are friendly neighbours.

Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday began a 60,000-person trial of an experimental single-shot COVID-19 vaccine that, if proven effective, could simplify distribution of millions of doses compared with leading rivals requiring two doses.The company expects results of the Phase III trial by year end or early next year, Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said in a joint news conference with officials from the National Institutes of Health and the Trump administration.Explained: Why is Phase-3 of COVID-19 vaccine trial complicated?J&J plans to manufacture as many as 1 billion doses in 2021, and more after that, Dr. Stoffels said. Rival vaccines from Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca all require two shots separated by several weeks, which make them more difficult to administer and means twice as much vaccine is needed to inoculate the same number of people.“The benefits of a single-shot vaccine are potentially profound in terms of mass immunisation campaigns and global pandemic control,” Dr. Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher who helped design J&J's COVID-19 vaccine, said in a telephone interview.

The J&J vaccine also does not need to be stored at extremely cold temperatures, Dr. Barouch noted, another advantage over some rival vaccine candidates.J&J shares were up 1.2%.“Big news. Numerous great companies are seeing fantastic results. FDA (Food and Drug Administration) must move quickly,” U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet.J&J published a detailed study protocol for its Phase III trial on Wednesday on the company's website, joining the three other vaccine makers that have made these details available in recent weeks after calls for increased transparency in the trials.Protection ‘for a long time’Dr. Stoffels said J&J started the late-stage study after seeing positive results in its combined Phase I/II trial in the United States and Belgium. The company plans to release those results imminently.

 Dr. Stoffels said the safety and level of protection demonstrated in the earlier trial were on par with what was seen in the company's animal studies. The results showed a single dose could offer sufficient protection “for a long time,” he said.J&J's late-stage trial will be conducted at as many as 215 sites in the United States, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.The trial will assess whether the vaccine can prevent moderate to severe COVID-19 after a single dose. It will also seek to detect if the vaccine can prevent serious disease requiring medical intervention and whether it can prevent milder cases of the virus.Dr. Stoffels said it likely will take six weeks to two months to fully enroll the trial.J&J plans to manufacture doses before approval, so it will be ready to start distribution soon after an FDA green light.The trial will be overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will review vaccine safety and effectiveness at pre-set intervals.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said all three vaccines being supported by the federal government's Operation Warp Speed — J&J's, Moderna's and AstraZeneca's — share a common DSMB. Pfizer is running its own trial and has a separate DSMB, Collins said.

A paused vaccine trial is a good disruption 



 J&J's trial would be considered a success if it proves to be 60% effective, with a study protocol that could have an efficacy answer after 154 people became infected with the virus.Dr. Stoffels said the company will start counting COVID-19 infections within the study population 15 days after individuals are vaccinated.The DSMB will take its first look at the vaccine's efficacy after 20 trial participants have become infected.Dr. Collins said the DSMB does not include any government employees and is made up of “very highly experienced” scientists and statistical experts.“Until they are convinced that there's something there that looks promising, nothing is unblinded and sent to the FDA. So everybody should feel pretty reassured,” Dr. Collins said.His comments follow concerns that government scientists may be pressured to rush the vaccine testing process to boost U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election bid.In August, J&J signed an agreement with the British government on a global Phase III clinical trial to study a two-dose version of its vaccine, which will run in parallel with the single-dose trial.Dr. Stoffels, in the briefing, said the single-dose version would be “very important for emergency use.” The company will later test a booster dose that could produce even greater immunity to the virus, he added.

North Korean soldiers shot dead a suspected South Korean defector after interrogating him at sea, and burned his body over coronavirus fears, Seoul military officials said Thursday.The man had disappeared off a patrol vessel near the western border island of Yeonpyeong, the South Korean defence ministry said in a statement.He was wearing a lifejacket, a military official told AFP, adding that ""circumstances tell us that there was an intent to defect"", without providing evidence.According to the South's Yonhap news agency, the man was located by North Korean forces and questioned from a boat by an official wearing protective equipment.The killing took place after an ""order from superior authority"", Yonhap cited South Korean officials as saying.Seoul's defence ministry condemned the shooting as an ""outrageous act"".""We sternly warn North Korea that all responsibilities for this incident lie with it,"" it said.In July, a North Korean defector who had fled to the South three years ago sneaked back over the heavily fortified border into the impoverished nation. His crossing prompted North Korean officials to put the border city of Kaesong under lockdown amid fears that he may have carried the coronavirus.Coronavirus | North Korea convenes emergency meeting after suspected case reportedU.S. Forces Korea commander Robert Abrams said earlier this month that North Korean authorities had issued shoot-to-kill orders to prevent the coronavirus entering the country from China, creating a ""buffer zone"" at the border.The isolated North — whose crumbling health system would struggle to cope with a major virus outbreak — has not confirmed a single case of the disease that has swept the world since first emerging in China, the North's key ally.Pyongyang closed its border with China in January to try to prevent contamination, and in July state media said it had raised its state of emergency to the maximum level.

The Students Federation of India (SFI) has alleged that Indian Union Muslim League’s Manjeswaram MLA M.C. Kamaruddin and district panchayat president A.G.C. Basheer had collected ₹5 lakh each from 85 people for starting the Trikaripur Arts and Science College and did not pay the investors the promised dividends or return the money.SFI district secretary Albin Mathew said here on Wednesday that Mr. Kamaruddin, as chairman, and Mr. Basheer, as treasurer of the Trikaripur Education and Charitable Trust, had collected the money as investment for starting the college in 2013. But the college even now functions from Euro Towers, a shopping complex, which has no permission from the local panchayat.Wetland and Wakf landMr. Mathew alleged that for seven years the trust had managed to renew the affiliation to Kannur University every year, at first by showing a piece of land categorised as wetland and then some land belonging to Peace International at Padanna. The university cancelled the affiliation in 2017-2018 when the trust could not construct the building at the land of Peace International. He said the trust got the affiliation again, this time by showing a piece of land of Gem International School, which was reportedly part of a Wakf board property. Soon allegations of attempts to divert and sell the Wakf land cropped up, he said. The university cancelled the affiliation for 2020-21 citing lack of infrastructure and facilities and the trust approached the High Court and secured an interim order. According to the trust the construction could not be started owing to COVID-19. Principal K.V. Unnikrishnan said he was unaware of the allegations on embezzlement. Though the last Syndicate had approved the affiliation, the Vice Chancellor cancelled it and now the college had received an interim order from the High Court of Kerala for relocating the college in five months. Mr. Kamaruddin could not be contacted on phone despite repeated attempts. Sources said the MLA stepped down as chairman of the trust two days ago.

 The State government has decided to amend the Kerala Municipality Building Rules 2019 and the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules 2019 following complaints from organisations in the construction sector regarding some clauses. The Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday approved the draft suggestions.It has been decided to change the requirement of approach road width from 10 metres to 8 metres for buildings of hospitals, educational institutions, offices and auditoriums above 18,000 square metre. Another change was regarding the calculation of the floor area ratio (FAR), for which the old formula will be used henceforth. As per the old method, the FAR was calculated based on the floor area, but as per the rules notified in 2019, this was based on built-up area. The organisations in the construction sector had complained that this has led to reduction in floor area, based on which it was decided to revert to the old formula.

 Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, on Wednesday, urged people who have contracted COVID-19 and are asymptomatic to opt for home isolation and care, strictly according to the directions and guidelines of the Health Department.With COVID-19 cases surging in the State, health facilities and its infrastructure can be utilised strictly for those patients with symptoms and who may require a higher level of medical care, if those who are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms opt for home care, he said.He said that unnecessary fear and misconceptions about COVID-19 were preventing those with asymptomatic infections but who had adequate facilities at home, from opting for home care.While home isolation and care, if done strictly as per the guidelines issued by the Health Department, was nothing to be scared about, it had been noticed that even the friends and family of the infected persons were pushing them towards choosing only hospital care .Better recovery Mr. Vijayan said that apart from reducing the strain on the health system, remaining at home amongst one’s own family could help reduce the mental stress of the infected and help them recover better.He said that while deaths owing to COVID-19 were fewer among younger persons, when the total case numbers went up, mortality could rise among the younger age group also.He claimed that initial reports had indicated that a good number of those who were at the forefront of the strikes in the capital city had contracted the disease.

With sugar factories landing in trouble one after the other, the cane growers from Chittoor district, considered as the sugar bowl of Rayalaseema, are at their wits’ end as to when they would get their dues and who would buy their produce.Post-bifurcation, there were 29 sugar factories in Andhra Pradesh, which came down to 12 last year. Of the six in Chittoor district, The Chittoor Sugars and the Sri Venkateswara Sugars near Tirupati, both in the cooperative sector, have been non-functional since long. Of the four private factories, the ones at Buchinaidu Kandriga and Punganur have been under lockout. The Sri Rangaraja Puram factory is doing fairly well, while the one at Nindra, which is enduring tremendous financial crisis, has narrowly escaped auction of its machinery by getting an interim court order this week.The government scheduled the auction for September 10, but the factory sought more time and finally secured an interim court order. “We will wait for the final order and proceed with the auction process by getting the stay vacated,” Assistant Cane Commissioner M. John Victor told The Hindu. Farmers, who supplied cane to Buchinaidu Kandriga and Nindra factories, have to get ₹30 crore and ₹37.6 crore respectively. “The first one declared lockout last year and its properties are being auctioned, but the latter one is resisting such an attempt,” says Avula Srinivas Yadav, general secretary of the Cane Growers’ Association (Nindra Zone).A study of the cane sector shows that neither the farmers nor the factories are happy with the output. Monsoon vagaries apart, the major problems plaguing the industry are the perennial pendency in settlement of dues and plummeting of sugar price in the open market over the last decade. This has led to a drastic shrinkage in cane acreage, with majority of the farmers now looking for lucrative and less risky crops. “I stopped growing cane a decade ago as it was no longer remunerative,” opines Mangati Gopal Reddy, State president of Federation of Farmers’ Associations (FFA). Labour problemBeing a labour intensive crop, cane farmers incur huge cost esepcially during the harvesting. With local workers lacking the expertise, the farmers depend on importing workforce that comes at a premium. A farmer spends between ₹750 and ₹1,200 per tonne on labour. Smaller harvesters are the need of the hour, as larger ones are unable to manoeuvre the small landholdings. The factories can explore ancillary units to make ethanol and by-products to shore up revenues. It may be recalled that the co-generation units set up over the last decade had eaten away precious resources, instead of contributing to the factories’ profit.

She added that British Home Secretary Priti Patel’s pledge to make Channel crossings unviable now lies in tatters. Dan O’Mahoney, the government’s newly-appointed Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, met with the French ambassador on Tuesday to discuss the crisis.Migrants have long used northern France as a launching point to reach Britain, either stowed in trucks or on ferries. Many appear to have turned to small boats organized by smugglers during the coronavirus pandemic because virus restrictions have reduced traffic between France and Britain.

 A new smartphone app to boost the U.K.’s track-and-trace system to help control coronavirus transmissions will be rolled out across England and Wales on Thursday. The government said businesses will be required by law to display the official National Health Service (NHS) quick response (QR) code posters so that people can check-in at different premises with the new app. Features of the app include contact-tracing using Bluetooth, risk alerts based on postcode district, QR check-in at venues, symptom checker and test bookings. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) also sought to reassure the public that user privacy and data security lie at the heart of the app rollout.“We have worked extensively with tech companies, international partners, and privacy and medical experts -- and learned from the trials -- to develop an app that is secure, simple to use and will help keep our country safe,” U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.“Today’s launch marks an important step forward in our fight against this invisible killer and I urge everyone who can to download and use the app to protect themselves and their loved ones,” the minister said, reiterating his previous warning of the U.K. being at a “tipping point” in its efforts to control the spread of this virus with infection rates rising. The new app will be available to those aged 16 years and above in multiple languages, including Indian languages such as Punjabi, Gujarati and Bengali. The contact-tracing element of the app works by using low-energy Bluetooth to log the amount of time a person spends near other app users and the distance between them, so it can alert users if someone they have been close to later tests positive for COVID-19 — even if they do not know each other. The app will then advise users to self-isolate if they have been in close contact with a confirmed case. It will also enable them to check symptoms, book a free test if needed and get the test results.“We want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to engage with England’s NHS Test and Trace service,” said Dido Harding, Executive Chair of England’s NHS Test and Trace Programme.“The NHS COVID-19 app enables the majority of people with a smartphone to find out if they are at risk of having caught the virus and need to self-isolate, order a test if they have symptoms and access the right guidance and advice,” she said. The DHSC said the NHS Test and Trace team behind the app has worked closely with major tech companies, including Google and Apple, scientists within the Alan Turing Institute and Oxford University, Zuhlke Engineering, medical experts, privacy groups, at-risk communities and teams in countries across the world using similar apps — such as Germany — to develop an app that is “safe, simple and secure“.It stressed that the app does not hold personal information and no personal data is shared with the government or the NHS. In a joint statement, Apple and Google said: “We built the exposure notifications system to enable public health authorities in their efforts to develop apps to help reduce the spread of the virus while ensuring that people can trust the privacy-preserving design.“We are committed to supporting the government’s effort to launch an app based on this technology.” The app has been through “rigorous” U.K. trials in the Isle of Wight, Newham borough of London and among NHS volunteer responders, which are claimed to have been successful. Simon Thompson, Managing Director of the NHS COVID-19 app, described it as so much more than just a contact-tracing app, with a range of features to alert users to the risk of coronavirus.“The more people use it, the better it works. We are confident that every person who downloads the app will be helping to protect themselves and their loved ones,” he said. The DHSC also confirmed that the mobile phone industry has committed to supporting the new app with the country’s major operators — Vodafone, Three, EE and O2, Sky and Virgin — “zero-rating” data charges for all in-app activity. This means people will not be charged for data when using the in-app functions or if they are directed out of the app to information on NHS websites.

Two white policemen who fired into the apartment of Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker, will not be prosecuted for her death because their use of force was justified, and a third was charged with endangering her neighbors, Kentucky's attorney general said on Wednesday.Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced the Louisville grand jury's decision at a news conference, as protesters against racial injustice and police brutality massed in the streets of Kentucky's largest city.Protests were largely peaceful. But about a dozen people were arrested in one confrontation between hundreds of demonstrators and dozens of heavily armed law enforcement officers in riot gear just outside downtown Louisville.Former Detective Brett Hankison was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree, an offense that ranks at the lowest level of felony crime in Kentucky and carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison.Benjamin Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing the Taylor family, said it was “outrageous” that none of the officers would be criminally charged with causing Taylor's death.Taylor, 26, was killed in front of her armed boyfriend shortly past midnight on March 13 inside her Louisville apartment after Hankison and his two colleagues forced their way in with a search warrant.The two other officers, Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove, were not charged because they were justified under Kentucky law in returning fire after Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, shot at them, wounding Mattingly in the thigh, Cameron said.“There is no doubt that this is a gut-wrenching, emotional case,” Cameron, a Black Republican, said at a news conference.Governor Andy Beshear called on Cameron to release all evidence in the case so that the public could better understand the outcome of the investigation.“Everyone can and should be informed,” Beshear said. “Those feeling frustration, hurt - they deserve to know more.”Hankison fired his weapon 10 times. Some of the bullets traveled through Taylor's apartment into adjacent Apartment No. 3, where a man, a pregnant woman and a child were at home.There was “no conclusive” evidence that any of Hankison's bullets struck Taylor, Cameron said. The grand jury indicted him for wantonly placing the neighbors in danger, Cameron said.Protest organizers expressed frustration at the outcome.Hundreds of demonstrators wound their way out of downtown Louisville's Jefferson Square Park and marched through the streets chanting, “Out of the homes, into the streets!”In a suburban area at the edge of downtown, protesters threw water bottles at police, who responded by firing pepper balls into the crowd. Pushing and shoving ensued between the two sides, and some demonstrators broke windows of businesses in the area.“If Brett Hankison's behavior was wanton endangerment to people in neighboring apartments, then it should have been wanton endangerment in Breonna Taylor's apartment too,” Crump said. “In fact, it should have been ruled wanton murder!”72-hour curfewAhead of the announcement, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced a 72-hour curfew for the city beginning at 9 p.m. ”I urge everybody to choose peaceful and lawful protest,” Fischer said. At a news conference later, he said the U.S. Justice Department was continuing to investigate whether any federal laws were broken, including potential civil rights violations.“It's clear that there are policies and procedures that needed to be changed, because Breonna Taylor should still be alive,” he said. “Let's turn to each other, not on each other, at this moment of opportunity.”Despite having a warrant that allowed them to enter the premises unannounced, the three officers involved knocked on Taylor's apartment door and announced their presence outside, which was corroborated by a neighbor, Cameron said. Getting no answer, they “breached the door,” he said.Mattingly entered first, and at the end of a corridor saw Taylor and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, with Walker pointing a gun. Walker fired, injuring Mattingly in the thigh. Mattingly returned fire, and his colleagues began shooting soon after, Cameron said.Six bullets struck Taylor, he said, contradicting reports she had been hit five times. Ballistics investigators found only one shot, fired by Cosgrove, was fatal, Cameron said.In June, the Louisville Metro Police Department fired Hankison with interim Police Chief Robert Schroeder writing that Hankison “displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life” when he “wantonly and blindly fired” into Taylor's home. The department reassigned Mattingly and Cosgrove to administrative duties. Local news media reported that Hankison turned himself into authorities on Wednesday at an area detention center, and was released on $15,000 bond. In obtaining a warrant as part of an investigation of a drug ring, police told a judge they believed that one of the men suspected of selling drugs had used Taylor's apartment to receive packages.Taylor had previously dated a suspected drug seller but had severed ties with him, according to her family.She and Walker were in bed when police broke down her door with a battering ram shortly after midnight, the families' representatives have said.Louisville has agreed to pay $12 million to Taylor's family to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit, Mayor Fischer announced earlier this month. He said Wednesday the settlement was intended to “begin the healing process.”

U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday again declined to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses the November 3 presidential election.“We’re going to have to see what happens,” Trump said at a news conference, responding to a question about whether he’d commit to a peaceful transfer of power. “You know that I’ve been complaining very strongly about the ballots, and the ballots are a disaster.” Trump has been pressing a monthslong campaign against mail-in voting this November by tweeting and speaking out critically about the practice. More states are encouraging mail-in voting to keep voters safe amid the coronavirus pandemic. The President, who uses mail-in voting himself, has tried to distinguish between states that automatically send mail ballots to all registered voters and those, like Florida, that send them only to voters who request a mail ballot.Trump has baselessly claimed widespread mail voting will lead to massive fraud. The five states that routinely send mail ballots to all voters have seen no significant fraud. Trump on Wednesday appeared to suggest that if states got “rid of” the unsolicited mailing of ballots there would be no concern about fraud or peaceful transfers of power. ""You’ll have a very peaceful - there won’t be a transfer frankly,” Trump said. “There’ll be a continuation. The ballots are out of control, you know it, and you know, who knows it better than anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else.” In a July interview, Trump similarly refused to commit to accepting the results, and he made similar comments ahead of the 2016 election. The Biden campaign responded Wednesday, as it did after Trump’s July comments- “The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.” It is highly unusual that a sitting President would express less than complete confidence in the American democracy’s electoral process. But Trump four years ago, when in the closing stages of his race against Hillary Clinton, also declined to commit to honoring the election results if the Democrat won.When asked during an October 2016 debate about whether he would abide by the voters’ will, Trump responded that he would “keep you in suspense.” It’s unlikely that any chaos in states with universal mail-in voting will cause the election result to be inaccurately tabulated, as Trump has suggested.The five states that already have such balloting have had time to ramp up their systems, while four states newly adopting it - California, New Jersey, Nevada and Vermont - have not. Washington, D.C., is also newly adopting it. Of those nine states, only Nevada is a battleground, worth six electoral votes and likely to be pivotal only in a national presidential deadlock. California, New Jersey, Vermont and D.C. are overwhelmingly Democratic and likely to be won by that party’s nominee, former Vice President Joe Biden.

 The West Bengal government has decided to extend the period of austerity measures taken to meet the expenditure for tackling the coronavirus pandemic from this September to March 31 next year. “The validity of this department memorandum specifying additional austerity measures to be followed by all state government and semi state government offices to tackle the huge unforeseen expenditure for combating Covid-19 disease in our state extended upto September 30. “Now, the validity of the memorandum is further extended upto March 31 or until further order, whichever is earlier,” a finance department said in an order on Tuesday. As per the memorandum issued on April 2, no new schemes have been taken up and prior approval of the finance department was sought for any urgent public interest programmes, official sources said. The government had also said that no purchase of vehicles, computers, IT related accessories, furniture, ACs and TVs would be undertaken. The memorandum had further said that there should be no recruitment/engagement of manpower unless approved by the finance department.

Sunil S. Shetty, 24, has been a gym regular for the past 10 years. Working out is an essential part of his life, “like brushing my teeth”, he says. He missed going to the gym for five months during the COVID-19 lockdown. Home workouts – lacking in equipment and trainer advice – wasn’t a sufficient substitute. Three weeks after August 5, when gyms in the city were allowed to re-open, Sunil resumed training at a fitness studio in Nagavara. But it’s not the same experience. “With the pandemic still on, working out at gyms isn’t the same as it used to be. We need to adjust,” he says.Sunil, however, seems to be an exception. Fitness trainers and gym owners say most customers haven’t returned. Their relief after the post-lockdown resumption was momentary.“Business is almost as bad as it was during the lockdown,” says Dinesh Kumar, fitness manager of Plej Fitness in Panathur. The daily footfall in his gym has plummeted from 300 before the pandemic to 20 at present. At the same time, the cost of everyday maintenance has surged. As per the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare guidelines, gyms have to reorganise their space so that people can maintain a distance of six feet from each other. They also have to stock up on disinfectants, sanitisers, and face shields, among other things.“I hired two people just to clean and disinfect the gym,” says Vikram Rao, owner of Muscle Kraft Fitness Studio. Up to 12 people can work out simultaneously at his 2,400 sq.ft. gym as per the guidelines. But less than 25 people turn up every day.Quadz Fitness trainer Pradeep A. says, “Footfall is down from 300 to 30. There are no new subscriptions. Even renewals have stopped. We used to have a target of about ₹5 lakh a month. Now, doing business of ₹30,000 seems challenging. Most trainers, who left for their hometowns during the lockdown, haven’t returned as they can’t sustain themselves in Bengaluru with what they will earn now.”Gyms are sharing photos and videos of the cleaning and physical distancing to reduce anxiety among clients. “But some people don’t come due to family pressure. They either have an elder or a child at home,” said Vikram.Plej Fitness halved their subscription rates to attract customers, but to no avail. “Many of our customers were IT professionals who live in nearby in PG accommodation. Most of them work from their hometowns now,” says Dinesh, “We keep calling and messaging those who live in the city. But they don’t come due to safety concerns. We can’t persuade them after a point. More than the actual safety, it’s a mental block.” Vikash Gupta, who used to work out four times a week at his gym in Yelahanka, cites the daily rise in cases and the death toll. “On one hand, you see pictures and videos of people cleaning your gym, which are reassuring. But on the other hand, you see the number of COVID-19 cases increasing every day. Maybe, it will take a month or two before I can have the confidence to go to the gym again.”Vikram, along with the other gym owners and trainers, hopes that the new year will bring a change in fortune. “That’s the best time for us. People take up new resolutions and a lot of people sign up. We are expecting a lot of people to join and re-join gyms.”

A village headman in Etawah district whose administrative and financial powers were ceased by the administration over allegations of misappropriation of funds in building toilets and rural homes has got his powers restored by the Allahabad High Court.The pradhan alleged that he was targetted by the administration and BJP leaders as part of political vendetta as he was affiliated to the opposition Samajwadi Party. The case comes as the State political atmosphere heats up ahead of the coming rural body elections.Magisterial orderThe administrative and financial powers of Sunil Kumar Yadav, pradhan of the Asafpur gram panchayat, were ceased by an order by the District Magistrate under Section 95 (1) (g) of the Uttar Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1947 on August 20. Charges against Mr. Yadav were found prima facie proved in the preliminary enquiry charges against him, recorded the DM’s order.The pradhan challenged the order, arguing that the procedure laid down in the Uttar Pradesh Panchayat Raj (Removal of Pradhans, Up-Pradhans and Members) Enquiry Rules, 1997 was not followed. Mr. Yadav also contended that he was neither issued any show-cause notice nor did the DM record satisfaction justifying invocation of power under Section 95 (1) (g) of the Uttar Pradesh Panchayat Raj Act, 1947.While putting a stay on the DM’s order till the next hearing, a Bench of Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra allowed the pradhan to continue in his post and exercise his administrative and financial powers.A perusal of the order passed by the DM does not reveal that any show-cause notice was issued to the petitioner nor his version was considered, said the court in a September 19 order.‘Political vendetta’Mr. Yadav alleged that the administration took action against him at the behest of BJP leaders as part of a “political vendetta.” He pointed out that the administration ceased his powers after recommendations for conducting an inquiry were made by BJP MP Ram Shankar Katheria, BJP MLA from Barthana, Savitri Katheria and BJP district president Ajay Pratap Singh Dhakre.In a June 2 letter to the district Magistrate, MLA Katheria asks for a probe against the pradhan accusing him of “misleading” the eligible beneficiaries of toilets and rural homes under the Swachh Bharat Mission and Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana and misallocation of funds.“All the construction work was complete. But some projects were disturbed for three months as my brother was murdered. The material was ready but the construction could not take off and then came the lockdown,” Mr. Yadav told The Hindu.He accused the BJP leaders of applying “pressure” on the administration for taking action against him in a hurried manner.“My powers were ceased without even issuing me a notice,” he said. The court granted the State four weeks to file a counter-affidavit.Mr. Dhakre, however, maintained that the pradhan was involved in corruption to the tune of almost ₹75 lakh. “Probe was conducted in three phases against the pradhan and he was found involved in corruption in all three probes. The toilets and homes were found only on paper. Besides, the BJP was not probing it, officials were,” he said.

The Kolkata tram may be a pale shadow of its glorious days, but it is still an iconic image of the city. College Street happens to be the prestigious address of some of the oldest educational institutions in the country, and also boasts rows of bookshops on either side. Now, a tram is set to recreate the academic ambience. It is built like a library and will roll down College Street, giving passengers a glimpse of the University of Calcutta, Presidency University and the hundreds of book stalls.From Thursday, people can ride the tram library, an air-conditioned car converted into a library on wheels. It will make six trips on the recently restored Esplanade-Shyambazar route.West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC), which oversees India’s only functional tramway, has introduced the service to rekindle the love for trams and reading. The initiative brings together unique aspects of the city’s cultural heritage: trams, which form an intrinsic part of the colonial legacy and its love for books on College Street, which is called ‘Boi Para’ (street of books) by many. While the first trams were launched in 1873, and were electrified in 1900, educational institutions on College Street like the Presidency University opened over 200 years ago in 1817. Attracting students“The idea is to make the tram the mode of choice for Kolkata’s students once again,” said Rajanvir Singh Kapur, MD of WBTC. In addition to the titles housed within, the tram library will provide readers access to online books. There will be no additional charge, the ticket provides passengers access. There will be 25 stops along the 5 km route, five of them on College Street.The library is just a beginning this winter, says an official. It could be the venue of book launches and book readings this season. Kolkata hosts a number of literary festivals and there is a search on for new venues. There are plans to have a Literary Festival around the tram library in the next two months, in November 2020.Cyclone Amphan, which battered the city on May 20 severely damaged tram infrastructure. After restoration, four routes have been opened. The library will be on the fifth route.

The lockdown did not contribute to a “significant improvement” in water quality assessed in 19 major rivers of India, the Central Pollution Control Board has said in a report released on Wednesday. However nearly three in four water samples analysed met designated standards.Previous analysis has shown that the lockdown helped majorly reduce air pollution in several cities.Water samples were collected as part of the agency’s routine National Water Quality Monitoring programme, under which samples are collected at designated periods and assessed for parameters such as Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD, or the extent of microbial life); Dissolved Oxygen (DO, to judge the effect of organic pollutants), pH (acidity level), and faecal coliform (FC, or microbes from human and animal waste). These measurements are used to determine if the water conforms to bathing or drinking quality. For the purpose of the latest assessment, the CPCB only checked if the water was fit to bathe in.In March, before the lockdown was announced, water samples from 387 monitored locations were gleaned and 299 of them (77.26 %) met bathing water criteria. In April — once the lockdown was in effect — it emerged that 277 of 365 locations monitored (75%) met the criteria. “This implies that there was no significant improvement in water quality of major rivers monitored in the country during the lockdown period,” the report notes.Four rivers — Baitarani, Mahanadi, Narmada and Pennar — met standards both before and during lockdown. River Ghaggar met criteria during neither. Seven rivers — Brahmani, Brahmaputra, Cauvery, Godavari, Krishna, Tapi and Yamuna — improved on water quality parameters from pre-lockdown to lockdown. This, the agency says, was likely due to a reduction in industrial effluent discharges in view of closure of almost all industries, no disposal of worshipped puja materials and garbage, no outdoor bathing, no washing of clothes and vehicles, no pilgrimage activities and a reduction in cattle movement for washing them in rivers.Water quality declined in the two periods in five rivers — in the Beas, Chambal, Ganga, Sutlej and Swarnarekha. This was likely due to the discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage; lack of flow because of the dry season; and no fresh water discharges from the upstream.Rivers that met compliance criteria were able to do so because they had adequate sewage treatment infrastructure in place and may have also had enough water to dilute the concentration of pollutants.To be considered fit for bathing, a river must have a BOD of <3 milligram per litre, DO >5 milligram per litre, a pH from 6.5 to 8.5 and FC less than 2500 per 100 millilitre.

Australia's Westpac Banking Corp said on Thursday it would pay A$1.3 billion ($920 million) to settle a case filed by the country's financial crimes watchdog against the lender for breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws.Last November, AUSTRAC filed a civil lawsuit accusing the Sydney-based bank of presiding over 23 million payments that violated anti-money laundering protocols, including payments by Australians to child pornography purveyors in the Philippines.The A$1.3 billion penalty, which both Westpac and AUSTRAC have agreed to recommend to the court, is larger than the A$900 million provision made by the country's second-largest bank in its first-half results.“We are committed to fixing the issues to ensure that these mistakes do not happen again. This has been my number one priority,” said Westpac Group Chief Executive Peter King.“We have also closed down relevant products and reported all relevant historical transactions.”Westpac added it would increase the provision in its accounts for the year ending September 30 by a further A$404 million to account for the higher estimated penalty and additional costs.

 A Mexican who was once the world’s heaviest man has beaten the coronavirus, helped -- he believes -- by several years of dieting, exercise and stomach-reduction surgery that saw him shed hundreds of kilos.Juan Pedro Franco used to weigh 595 kilos (1,310 pounds) — more than the average male polar bear and enough to be certified by Guinness World Records in 2017.The 36-year-old now weighs around 208 kilos, but his history of diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease made his battle against the virus particularly gruelling.“It’s a very aggressive disease. I had a headache, body ache, breathing difficulty, a fever. I was a very high-risk person,” Franco told AFP from his home in the central state of Aguascalientes.Mexico, which has the world’s fourth-highest Covid-19 death toll, has the highest obesity rate on the planet among children and the second-highest among adults.A quarter of the more than 74,000 Mexicans who have died after catching the virus were overweight.Many of the dead suffered from at least one underlying condition such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, often associated with a poor diet and lack of exercise.“Patients who are diabetic, have hypertension and heart disease are more susceptible to serious complications” from the virus, said Jose Antonio Castaneda, the doctor who headed the team that treated Franco’s obesity.“Their chances of pulling through are very slim,” he added.His patient, who was once too heavy to get out of bed, was an exception.Franco, who lost his 66-year-old mother to Covid-19, believes that his weight loss treatment — including three operations — helped him to survive because his diabetes and hypertension are now under control.

A 22-year-old youth, who was denied treatment for a stab injury by 10 hospitals in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack for the past 15 days, was finally operated upon on Tuesday night after the Orissa Human Rights Commission (OHRC) intervened. The OHRC took the action on an appeal by the victim’s brother.The rights panel directed city-based hospital KIMS to take up the case and the victim was operated upon on Tuesday night. According to petitioner Pabitra Nayak, a resident of Bhubaneswar, his brother, Ranjit Nayak, was stabbed by a neighbour over a mobile theft case at 6.30 p.m. on September 8. After assessing his health condition, the Chandrasekhar police asked his parents to admit him in hospital at 7 p.m. It was the beginning of an ordeal.Human rights activist Pradip Pradhan said the victim, who was bleeding, was rushed to two government hospitals, AIIMS, Bhubaneswar and Capital Hospital, and all six top private hospitals in the city, but was denied admission. Throughout the intervening night of September 8 and 9, the family members ran from pillar to post, but nobody paid heed to them while the victim struggled in pain. Similarly, they spent the whole of September 9 hopping from one hospital to another in Cuttack, including Odisha’s top referral hospital – SCB Medical College Hospital. They could not find a bed. For the next one week, family members made repeated requests to different hospitals, but in vain. On September 22, the OHRC stepped in. “We don’t know why hospitals in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack refused admission. The fear of COVID infection might have played a role. After six months of the pandemic, the government should have been prepared to handle such cases,” said Mr. Pradhan, who accompanied the family members to the OHRC. The OHRC also directed the State government to conduct an inquiry into the allegations and submit a report by October 15. Hospitals were asked to respond to charges of the victim.

Linguistic minority students in Rajasthan have been deprived of education in their mother tongue, with the books in Urdu, Sindhi and Punjabi not being supplied to over 20,000 government schools and the teachers not being appointed in the current academic session. A recent decision of the State government in this regard has led to resentment among the students.In a clarification on the staffing pattern, the Directorate of Elementary Education earlier this month ordered withdrawal of teachers of more than one “third language” from the schools. This has effectively resulted in the teaching of only Sanskrit as the third language, to the exclusion of all others.Though Minister of State for Education Govind Singh Dotasra has since affirmed that the education in mother tongue would be imparted to all students, the September 2 order has so far not been cancelled. The children belonging to linguistic minority communities are forced to opt for Sanskrit in the three-language formula of schooling.The “Shala Darpan” web portal of the Education department, on which the government schools usually upload their demands and activities, does not give an option for supply of books in any language other than Sanskrit. In the online classes started during the COVID-19 pandemic, the students are unable to understand the lessons in the absence of books.Though the academic session started in July, the Directorate of Education has only last week issued the orders prescribing books for the linguistic minority students in the upper primary classes. While the Urdu books will be obtained from the National Council for Educational Research & Training (NCERT), the books in Sindhi and Punjabi will be brought from Maharashtra and Punjab, respectively.Rajasthan Urdu Shikshak Sangh president Ameen Kayamkhani said here on Wednesday the rules framed in 2004 had provided for appointment of a third language teacher on the availability of a minimum of 10 students in a class. “After the initial appointments by the District Education Officers, this provision has been gradually diluted. It is not implemented any more,” he said.While pointing out that the linguistic minority children comprised about 10% of the students in government schools, Mr. Kayamkhani said the Urdu education had been “practically abolished” from first to fifth classes and was being gradually finished in VI to X classes. Several schools situated in the minority-dominated areas force their students to study only Sanskrit as the third language.In a particular instance of the Government Girls’ Secondary School at Bhatta Basti in Jaipur, all the 497 students coming from Urdu-speaking families are compelled to study Sanskrit. Students and their parents have staged demonstrations at several places across the State, while affirming that this was an infringement of the provisions of the Right of Children to Free & Compulsory Education Act, 2009.

 While the pandemic has posed a challenge to the television and film industry, it has come as an opportunity for the Bengali online video streaming platform Hoichoi. The Bengali entertainment platform that completed three years of operation this September has registered an increase in revenue and revealed that 40% of the revenue comes from international subscribers.Last week, the Bengali OTT (Over the Top) platform unveiled 25 web shows and two films — Kolkata Underground and Tiktiki — to be launched in the coming months.Vishnu Mohta, co-founder of Hoichoi, told The Hindu that the platform has provided the Bengali diaspora an opportunity to connect to its roots through these productions.“About 40% of our direct revenue is coming from international customers. We have subscribers in more than 100 countries including Japan, Sweden, Argentina, Iceland, where we did not think we would have much traffic,” he said. Mr. Mohta said that the OTT shows were a “ great way to connect” the Bengali community, as films and plays in the language may not be available in theatres in other countries.Even since the lockdown, the platform has been showing a big spurt in growth on most matrices and the subscribers across all platforms are now 13 million. In recent months, it released nine world digital premiers of feature films and showcased the first direct-to-digital film release from eastern India.Actors Swastika Mukherjee, Parambrata Chattopadhyay and Saswata Chatterjee and directors Srijit Mukherji and Mainak Bhaumik are some of the film personalities behind the programmes to be launched soon.While the OTT platform celebrates different genres, thrillers and detective stories are high in demand. “The Bengali community always loves detective stories and thriller shows. Some of the most iconic characters like Feluda and Byomkesh have been detectives. This goes very well from an episodic point of view,” Mr Mohta added.

The Gujarat Assembly on Wednesday passed the Gujarat Gunda and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act which seeks to deal with anti-social elements in a stringent manner. The government said it wants to make the State free of crime and protect innocent people from harassment.The move appears an oblique acknowledgment of rise in crimes in a big setback to law and order in an otherwise ‘peaceful’ State. Under the present dispensation, the State’s famed law and order has deteriorated in business hubs like Surat and Jamnagar where organised crimes like extortion, land grabbing and money lending have flourished without any check. The diamond city Surat has witnessed several suicides in the last few months related to extortion and money lending. The latest victim was Durlabh Patel in Mandvi taluka of Surat.Mr. Patel named some people including money lenders, police officials and others who reportedly drove him to the extreme step because he had refused to hand over a piece of land to the money lenders. The recent instances of land mafia taking over entire schemes of builders, daylight murders of bootleggers and the rise of anti-social elements appear to have the blessings of the local police. Following several such suicides in Surat, Police Commissioner Ajay Tomar has acted tough with cops saying no Inspector would initiate probe in land-related matters without approval from the top. He restrained lower level officials from getting involved in such matters after the nexus among police, anti-social elements and local gangsters came to light in a few cases. Similarly, the administration was forced to send Ahmedabad crime branch DCP Deepan Bhadran to Jamnagar as SP to deal with the rising cases of extortion in the industrially prosperous district. Sitting abroad like Dawood Ibrahim, Jamnagar’s most dreaded mafia don Jayesh Patel with help and protection from some politicians is running an extortion syndicate targeting local builders, businessmen, realtors and industrialists, who are allegedly routinely forced to pay “protection money” to him and his aides while the police and the local administration helplessly watch everything as mute spectators.According to local sources in Jamnagar, in just the last six months, ₹25 crore has been extorted by the gang from several top businessmen, land dealers and builders in the city.Patel is a key accused in 40 FIRs related to extortion, ransom and property disputes in Jamnagar. In 2018, he reportedly fled to Dubai after his gang members allegedly murdered a local advocate Kirit Joshi. “Crime is rising even in business hubs like Surat and Jamnagar. The government has no control over local gangsters who enjoy political protection from local leaders,” said leader of the Opposition Paresh Dhanani.

 J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Wednesday approved the proposal of the Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj to issue a notification for conducting elections to vacant sarpanch and panch constituencies in the Union Territory. “Filling of the vacant constitutional posts will ensure devolution of powers and proper grass-roots planning in the third-tier of the local self-government. It will ensure that the non-functional Panchayats become functional,” an official spokesman said.The detailed schedule of these elections will be finalised by the election authority.Out of the 39,521 sarpanch and panch constituencies where polls were conducted in 2018, around 13,257 positions were vacant for many reasons.“Around 1,089 vacancies pertain to the office of sarpanch, whereas 12,168 are panch vacancies,” the official said. The elections to the vacancies notified earlier were postponed due to security concerns and the onset of COVID-19 in J&K.

 Frank de Boer, who won 112 caps and played at two World Cups for the Netherlands, has been appointed his country’s national team coach, the Dutch football association (KNVB) said on Wednesday.The 50-year-old replaced Ronald Koeman, who left last month to take over as Barcelona coach, and has signed a two-year contract up to the 2022 World Cup.Former defender De Boer, who also played for Barcelona and Ajax Amsterdam, won a record four successive Dutch league titles as coach of Ajax between 2011 and 2014.But three subsequent jobs outside the Netherlands proved disappointing. He was fired by Inter Milan after 85 days in charge in 2016 and the next year lasted 10 weeks at Crystal Palace.His last position was at Atlanta United in Major League Soccer where he led the club to cup success before leaving in July after 18 months in charge.De Boer will be thrust quickly into his new job with a friendly against Mexico and two Nations League games early next month. The Netherlands host the Mexicans in Amsterdam on Oct. 7 before travelling to Bosnia on Oct. 11 and Italy on Oct. 14.De Boer will lead the Netherlands into next year's rescheduled European Championship, their first major tournament since the 2014 World Cup.Beaten World Cup finalists in 1974, 1978 and 2010, the Dutch recently endured one of their darkest periods as they failed to qualify for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup before Koeman revived their fortunes.

Between 4% and 20% of adults in Indore who had recovered from COVID-19 in the past four months and came forward to donate plasma had either no or a very low level of antibodies, two city hospitals have found. At the privately owned Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences (SAIMS), the largest COVID-19 facility, the samples of 17 of the 378 prospective donors had either no or a very low level of antibodies. Similarly, 25 of the 130 prospective donors at the government-run Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College (MGMMC) reported such low levels of antibodies, thus rendering them ineligible. Specialists were noticing antibodies generated faster in some than others, said Vinod Bhandari, owner of SAIMS, where recovered persons came 28-42 days after having contracted the disease. “It depends on the viral load. Nearly half the asymptomatic ones reported low antibody levels.” Ashok Yadav, head of department, Transfusion Medicine, at the MGMMC, where persons came within four months, noticed that the antibody count went down with time. “Those who have recovered from a serious condition have more of them and for a longer duration.”Asked whether recovered individuals with no or low levels of antibodies could contract the illness again, Dr. Yadav said it was still being researched. “However, it also depends on the T or memory cells whose presence can help produce antibodies quickly in case of reinfection,” he said.

 Kai Havertz scored his first goals for Chelsea with a hat-trick in a 6-0 thrashing of Barnsley as Arsenal also booked their place in the League Cup fourth round with a more hard-fought 2-0 win at Leicester.Havertz had struggled to make an impact in his first two Premier League games since sealing a reported £71 million ($94 million) move from Bayer Leverkusen as the most expensive signing of Chelsea's £200 million spending spree in the transfer market.But the 21-year-old German was one of just three players to retain his place from Sunday's 2-0 defeat to Liverpool by Frank Lampard and that decision reaped its reward on a confidence-boosting night for the Blues.Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell also made their Chelsea debuts, while Tammy Abraham and Ross Barkley made the most of rare starts to get their names on the scoresheet.Abraham pounced on loose pass deep in the Barnsley half to slam home the opener before Havertz's calm finish opened his Chelsea account.A brilliant unselfish flick from Abraham teed Havertz up perfectly to convert his second and Barkley then drove home on his weaker left foot.Havertz was due to be replaced by Chilwell 25 minutes from time but just completed his hat-trick in time by rounding Brad Collins before tapping into an empty net before Olivier Giroud completed the scoring.Chelsea will face either Tottenham or Leyton Orient in the last 16 with the outcome of that tie yet to be decided after the match was postponed on Tuesday due to a number of coronavirus cases among the Orient players.Arsenal won the only all-Premier League tie of the night as Christian Fuchs's own goal broke the deadlock at the King Power.Eddie Nketiah added a late second for the Gunners, who could face Liverpool at Anfield twice in three days next week should the Premier League champions progress past Lincoln on Thursday.Everton continued their fine start to the season with a 5-2 win at League One Fleetwood despite two howlers from England number one goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Carlo Ancelotti's men looked to be cruising into the last 16 when Richarlison's double gave them a deserved 2-0 half-time lead.However, Pickford's attempted clearance was charged down for Mark Duffy to pull a goal back.Alex Iwobi restored Everton's two-goal advantage before another Pickford mistake gave Joey Barton's men life again as he flapped Callum Camps's shot into his own goal.Goals from Bernard and Moise Kean finally ended the tie as a contest, but Pickford's place for both Ancelotti and Gareth Southgate will come under increased scrutiny in the coming weeks.Newcastle thrashed League Two Morecombe 7-0 with Joelinton scoring twice.Miguel Almiron, Jacob Murphy, Isaac Hayden and Jamaal Lascelles were also on the scoresheet for Steve Bruce's men.Fulham, Brighton and Burnley progressed 2-0 over Championship opposition in Sheffield Wednesday, Preston and Millwall respectively.Stoke were the only non-Premier League side to go through on the night as they also beat lower league opposition in Gillingham 1-0.

The test positivity rate has been under 10% for the past three weeks in spite of enhanced testing volumes, T. Arun, Health Secretary, said. “We have been testing in excess of 5,000 samples a day for the past week. This is at an optimal level and far exceeds the 3,000 a day target recommended by expert bodies,” he said.The tests are being assigned in a 50:50 ration split between RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Test methods.According to Mr. Arun, mortality analysis showed that an estimated 70% of deaths were occurring within 48 hours of admission even in symptomatic patients. “This indicates delayed reporting to hospital,” Mr. Arun said.While the administration has stepped up active surveillance through door-to-door visits by ASHA/ANM volunteers to carry out screening and tests, the fatalities can be lowered only with full cooperation of the public in seeking medical help as early as possible, he said.After a briefing with Mr. Arun and A.

C.

Gengairajan, 50, of Anbu Nagar, he had borrowed ₹30,000 from Mohan in December 2016 and paid ₹48,000 in interest — ₹3,000 a week for four months. However, due to his poor economic condition, he could not make further payments.In May 2017, he borrowed ₹15,000 from his brother-in-law and paid the sum to Mohan. He also handed over a cheque for ₹25,000. Thereafter, Mohan said his loan had been settled. When Mr. Gengairajan asked him to return the promissory note, Mohan said he would do so after two days. But he did not keep his word and started insisting since June that Mr. Gengairajan pay him interest for the loan.Mr. Gengairajan also accused Mohan of bringing four persons on Sunday and threatening him.

The lives of a COVID-19 positive woman, who was in the 28th week of her pregnancy, and her baby were saved by the decision to perform an emergency Caesarian section.N. Ezhilan, consultant, general medicine, Kauvery hospital, who treated her first, said she had severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 30% to 40% of her lungs were affected. “The presence of the foetus in the uterus was making it difficult as her lungs could not expand to the full capacity,” he said.Sabeeha T.S., senior consultant, obstetrics and gynaecology, said a decision was made to perform a Caesarian section to deliver the baby though the woman had not completed her full term of pregnancy. Hemalatha Iyanar, consultant anaesthesiologist, said they had to opt for general anaesthesia. N. Sridhar, head, critical care, said that after the delivery, the woman had to be kept under a medically induced coma and on ventilator to facilitate aggressive, invasive treatment needed to fight COVID-19 and mainly to improve her lung capacity. “We kept her in a prone position to improve oxygen level. Her lungs started improving after two days.”Karthik Thiagarajan, neonatalogist, said that though the baby was doing fine initially, sepsis and related complications set in after a week, and it remained critical for about three days. “We provided a combination of treatment...

Doctors at Gleneagles Global Health City hospital (GGHC) are treating a 32-year-old man with post-COVID-19 lung infection after airlifting him from Lucknow with Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.In a statement, the hospital said that though the man recovered from COVID-19, he developed a severe breathing difficulty two weeks later. He was kept on ventilator at a hospital in Lucknow, but his oxygen level was extremely low and the accumulation of carbon dioxide in his blood was alarmingly high. Further tests revealed his lungs had incurred 75% damage, necessitating either a transplant or ECMO support. The Lucknow hospital reached out to doctors at the GGHC. A decision was made to airlift the patient to Chennai, the statement said. Doctors from GGHC flew to Lucknow on September 16 and initiated ECMO support. After his condition was stabilised, the patient was shifted the next day in a chartered flight. Meticulous planning was required to keep the travel time to a minimum, the hospital said. This was the first time a patient in the country was airlifted with ECMO support.

A Surat-based anaesthetist who was put on ECMO after he endangered his life to treat another patient has recovered, according to a release from MGM Healthcare in the city. Sanket Mehta risked his life to intubate a patient in the intensive care unit of a Surat hospital where he too had been admitted for complications from COVID-19. Dr. Mehta removed his oxygen support lines to intubate a patient who required ventilator care in the same ICU. Dr. Mehta was off oxygen support for 15-20 minutes, which led to his having to be put on ECMO because of respiratory failure. As his condition deteriorated, he was shifted to MGM Healthcare. There were discussions about him having to undergo a lung transplant. The hospital was the first in Asia to perform a bilateral lung transplant in a COVID-19 patient. At the time of admission, Dr. Mehta’s lungs were stiff and did not contribute to oxygen exchange. His muscles were weak and he could only flick his fingers but not move his limbs. Slowly, he began to recover and his ventilation improved. The lungs cleared and X-rays showed he was able to maintain good oxygenation with 100% oxygen saturation. Suresh Rao, co-director, Institute of Heart and Lung Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support, said though doctors discussed lung transplant, it was not necessary as Dr. Mehta’s lung function recovered.On Tuesday, Dr. Mehta was taken off ECMO and his lungs with 40% oxygen support were able to sustain oxygenation at 100% oxygen saturation. As he has been undergoing intense physiotherapy, his muscle power has gone up from grade 0 to grade 2. His blood parameters are within normal range, his doctors said.

Chief Minister Edappadi K.

As many as 5,52,674 persons have tested positive, and there are only 46,350 active cases in the State. These tests cost nearly ₹6.8 crore a day,” Mr. Palaniswami said. He said he had visited and reviewed the performance of 26 districts, which have been effective in controlling the spread of the pandemic.Acknowledging the receipt of ₹511.64 crore from the Centre in two tranches under the Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness package, out of a total of ₹712.64 crore allotted to Tamil Nadu, he requested that the package for the State be enhanced to ₹3,000 crore.As Tamil Nadu had completely exhausted the State Disaster Response and Mitigation Fund, Mr. Palaniswami requested an immediate ad-hoc grant of ₹1,000 crore from the NDRF to fight the pandemic. “Releasing pending CMR subsidy of ₹1,321 crore at this time will facilitate paddy procurement,” he said.“Tamil Nadu is providing effective medical treatment, which has helped the State maintain a low death rate, currently at 1.62% — among the lowest in the country,” he said. “As of date, 4,97,377 patients have recovered, which works out to a recovery rate of about 90%, one of the highest in the country,” he added. “As of date, no district has a positivity rate of over 10%,” the CM noted. Referring to the Bill that was passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly providing 7.5% internal reservation in UG medical courses from the current academic year for NEET-qualified students who had studied in State government schools, Mr. Palaniswami said the legislation had been sent to the Governor for his assent. “This is expected to bring equity and social justice to predominantly poor students,” he said.

Nearly 3,000 devotees visit Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple everyday since relaxation of the lockdown but there were very few visitors to the shops near the temple.Pudhu Mandapam near the temple has about 150 shopkeepers selling puja articles, trinkets, books and kitchenware. There are also tailors. They have opened their doors to customers a month ago but many people do not visit these shops. S. K. Siddiq, one of the traders there, says that there is no market value for trinkets or other ‘fancy items’ these days. ‘It is understandable if people do not step in to buy our ear rings and bangles but it is surprising that even shops selling puja articles and idols do not get customers. Though people visit the temple, there is no improvement in business for traders.’ Pudhu Mandapam Traders and Tailors Association president G. Muthupandi says that many traders come to Pudhu Mandapam and go back to home. ‘Because our major ‘customers’ were tourists. The complete lack of foreign tourists visiting our shops has deeply hurt our business. We consider the whole of 2020, a washout year for us.’ M. Mohammad Abdul Khader, who sells toys, handbags and wallets to customers on East Chithirai Street, says that people nowadays visit the temple only for the purpose of worship. ‘Earlier, it was an outing for the whole family and sales were good. Now, we are not sure when sales will pick up. According to S. Venkatesan, who owns a shop in the junction between East and South Chithirai Street, the Tamil month of Purattasi is usually a lean period for sales. ‘We are hopeful of bouncing back by Deepavali,’ he says. Traders at Pudu Mandapam say that it would be useful if the temple authorities extend a concession on rent paid by shopkeepers. It would ease the financial burden. ‘We have submitted a petition and we are awaiting a response,’ the association members said.

India has tailwinds, such as its demographic advantage, to make it a high-growth economy, but the same cannot be considered foreordained and requires continued action, global private equity major Warburg Pincus CEO Charles Kaye said on Wednesday.Implementing the reforms vision is the “principal challenge” for India, he said, specifying that both the challenges and opportunities for the country are domestic in nature. Warburg Pincus has invested $5 billion in India since 1995. Its bets include HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank and Bharti Airtel, where it made handsome returns, setting a milestone for risk capital investing. “India has all the powerful tailwinds of demography and so much else, but that’s not destiny; it’s not foreordained and requires continued vigilance and significant action to continue to take advantage of that opportunity,” he emphasised.Speaking at a business summit via video, he said India had improved remarkably since 1995 when the firm first invested in HDFC but added that the main challenge for the country was to complete the reforms vision.  Offloaded responsibilityHe welcomed the policy response to the pandemic. “The more significant way it dealt with it is that it essentially offloaded responsibility... into the banking system and then provided meaningful monetary support through the RBI and moratoriums; we will see how it plays,” Mr. Kaye added. India’s strategy seemed to be “letting the recovery itself lead economic recovery”.

Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha, senior counsel Arvind P.

The senior counsel told the judge that his clients would fall under the definition of ‘intermediaries’ under the Information Technology Act of 2000 and were completely governed by the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules framed by the Centre. The submissions were made during the hearing of the PIL petition filed by K.

Since some of the advocates entered appearance on behalf of Netflix and other OTT platforms, the judges decided to hear the case in detail on October 14 after service of notices to all respondents and completion of pleadings before the court. They also told Mr. Dattar that Facebook and Instagram could remain as parties to the case and that the court would hear them if necessary.

 Saudi Arabia’s King Salman made a rare address to the UN General Assembly on Wednesday, using the moment to highlight the foundational notions of his regime — his steadfast commitment to the Palestinians, his stature as custodian of Islam’s holiest sites and his assertion that Iran is responsible for much of the region’s instability. The prerecorded speech to world leaders suggested that the 84-year-old king, who delivers only a handful of public remarks each year, retains oversight of high-level policies despite the immense powers amassed by his son, the crown prince. In delivering his remarks, he became only the second Saudi king to deliver a speech to the world assembly. The first was his late brother, King Saud, in 1957 at UN headquarters in New York. And like his brother’s speech 63 years prior, King Salman noted the sacred role of Islam in Saudi Arabia and the importance that entails.“We in the kingdom, due to our position in the Muslim world, bear a special and historic responsibility to protect our tolerant Islamic faith from attempts by terrorist organisations and extremist groups to pervert it,” Mr. Salman said. He emphasised at the top of his speech that he was speaking from the birthplace of Islam, the home of its revelation — a reference to the Muslim belief that the word of God was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad some 1,400 years ago in the mountainous caves of Mecca. Those words carry political undertones as well. Saudi rivals Turkey and Iran also profess to champion Muslim causes worldwide as part of a broader struggle for leadership of Muslims globally. The king oversees a nation that is the Arab world’s biggest economy and the planet’s most prolific oil producer. Saudi Arabia has long been a close US ally in the region and a strategic partner, though some in American politics worry where the relationship will go in coming years given the unpredictability of the brash Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Reading from a piece of paper and seated at a desk under a large portrait of his father, King Abdulaziz, the current monarch reiterated his support for Palestinian statehood as a prerequisite for recognition of Israel. He said the Arab Peace Initiative, which offers Israel full ties with Arab states in exchange for concessions that lead to a Palestinian state, provides a basis for resolving the region’s longest-running conflict. That 2002 initiative stands in stark contrast to the White House’s Middle East Peace plan, which has been rejected outright by the Palestinians as one-sided in favour of Israel. The king made no mention of recent deals struck by neighbouring United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to formalise ties with Israel. The agreements were brokered by the Trump administration and branded by the Palestinians as acts of betrayal. Despite the appearance on Wednesday that Salman was in control of major policies, there are indications that change is already underway with Israel under the guidance of the crown prince. The divergent messages on the possibility of Saudi ties with Israel reflect what analysts call a generational divide between the world views of the prince and the king. Salman hails from an era of leadership that holds with high regard the ideals of pan-Arab and pan-Islamic multilateralism. He was born just four years after his father founded the country by unifying tribes and establishing control over the western Hijaz region, where Mecca is located. He also witnessed the country’s oil-fueled transformation, and as the governor of Riyadh helped to turn the desert capital into a city teeming with skyscrapers, highways, universities and malls. His reign marks the final chapter of power being passed from brother to brother from among the sons of King Abdelaziz as a new generation prepares for the throne. The crown prince, on the other hand, reflects a cohort of younger Gulf Arab rulers whose policies prioritize national interests and greater self-reliance. He’s pushed for localising the production of defense equipment, transforming the economy to be less dependent on oil exports and overseen efforts to supplant a religiously conservative Saudi identity with one rooted in hyper-nationalism. King Salman has backed his son by elevating him from near obscurity and handing him day-to-day decision making powers. He’s stood by him amid the protracted Yemen war, international fallout from the killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 and as Prince Mohammed moved to crackdown on dissidents, businessmen and sideline more experienced and senior royals in the line of succession. It’s unclear how much the King knows about controversies, such as the November 2017 debacle with then-Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, whom top Lebanese officials at the time said had been forced to resign and was being held in Saudi Arabia against his will before France’s president personally intervened. What was clear as Salman spoke on Wednesday, though, was that his nation’s views on nearby Iran remained unwavering. He blamed Iran for targeting Saudi oil facilities with missiles and drones last year, saying: It demonstrated that this regime has total disregard for the stability of the global economy or stability of oil supplies to international markets.

Rohit starred with a 54-ball 80 to help defending champions Mumbai Indians to a 49-run win over KKR in Abu Dhabi. “It is not easy to play long innings here. It takes a lot out of you to play in these conditions. Maybe I was a bit tired in the end and it was a lesson for us that one set batsmen needs to bat deep till the end.  “We’ve seen it in the past and that’s what I tried to do,” Rohit said at the post-match presentation ceremony. During his stay in the middle, he played the pull shots to perfection and hit a couple of sixes. “I back myself to play the pull shots and have practised quite a bit. Pretty happy with the performance of my squad. All my shots were good (laughs), can’t pick one,” he said. Talking about his bowling attack, he said it was made keeping Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium in mind.  “We never knew that the IPL would happen in the UAE so we wanted a pace attack that was strong for the Wankhede. But the ball was seaming around for the first six overs over here as well.  “We haven’t played much with Trent Boult and (James) Pattinson, but it was good that we were on the same page.”  The result meant MI ended their winless streak in the UAE. “Only two players from the squad that lost five matches here in 2014. It is all about executing plans, which we did,” Rohit said. “We were always ahead of the game, but it was all about being ruthless.”  KKR skipper Dinesh Karthik said, “Pretty rusty day to be honest. Don’t want to be too analytical about it. The boys know where they need to get better. Pat Cummins and Morgan just finished their quarantine today. So it is not easy to come in and play in this heat.”  While Boult also said he was not comfortable playing in these conditions.  “I wouldn’t say I’m comfortable in these heat and conditions. It’s a big challenge to bowl against the likes of Morgan and Russell but it’s nice to come out on the winning side tonight.  “I have been bowling back in New Zealand and it’s the winter there, that’s been the biggest challenge but everyone is excited to have cricket around,” he said.

The construction of tuna fishing harbour at Tiruvottiyur Kuppam will resume shortly as the National Green Tribunal (NGT) vacated its stay recently. The Fisheries department had obtained the required environmental clearance from the State Environmental Impact Assessment Authority in August for the project. The State-level coastal regulation zone clearance had also been obtained for the project, said official sources in the department. The preliminary work for the ₹241.42-crore project that would allow 300 FRP boats, 300 trawlers and 200 tuna boats to be anchored safely, had been completed. The Kasimedu fishing harbour is used by around 300 tuna boats, and a section of those are expected to move to the new facility on completion. Local fishers would have a safe harbour, the official added. Facilities for fishersThe harbour that would help decongest the Kasimedu harbour, which is just 3.5 km away, would have quays for fish landing, outfitting, repairs and idling of boats. The facility would also have fish handling halls, auction hall, cold storage, ice factory, fuelling station, power back-up centres and dormitory for workers.

The Maharashtra Congress on Wednesday alleged a ‘dirty conspiracy’ by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to defame Maharashtra with the help of Bihar’s former DGP Gupteshwar Pandey by using the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. “There was a big dirty conspiracy by the BJP to defame Maharashtra to reduce its national importance. The Bihar DGP who was used in this is being blatantly rewarded. His voluntary retirement and quick approval says it all. The BJP had no sympathy for Rajput but saw a political opportunity to use his death for the Bihar elections and now for a new film city,” Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. He further said that there is no doubt that Mr. Pandey who defamed the Mumbai Police in the Rajput death case would soon get a big reward from the BJP for playing his part in the conspiracy. The Congress has also raised questions over the ongoing investigation by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) headed by Rakesh Asthana, labelling him as the blue-eyed boy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The NCB has had an office in Mumbai for many years. Why has there been no inquiry in the so-called Bollywood and drug connections so far? Secondly, the Enforcement Directorate had called the NCB to investigate the drug angle in the Sushant case. The NCB has not made any arrests so far as per the first FIR registered on 15/2020. The arrests have been made under the second FIR which was registered on 16/2020 which has nothing to do with the Sushant case,” Mr. Sawant said, asking whether the NCB has dropped its probe in the actor’s death case.

Maratha outfits on Wednesday warned the Maha Vikas Aghadi government of a Maharashtra shutdown on October 10 if it failed to explain how it planned to extend the benefits meant for the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) to the Maratha community. The State Cabinet on Tuesday decided to extend the 10% reservation meant for the EWS to the Maratha community. A ‘round table conference’ of Maratha outfits under the umbrella of ‘Maratha Arakshan (reservation) Action Samiti’ (MAAS) held on Wednesday in Kolhapur urged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and his Cabinet to clarify how exactly the government planned to implement what it had announced. “This time, we want to make sure that the government keeps its promises. We are giving them time till October 9 to clarify its decision. Failing this, we will stage a complete shutdown in Maharashtra on October 10. The bandh, if held, will be peaceful with all emergency services on,” Suresh Patil, who heads the MAAS, said. Stating that protests across the State would not cease until the Maratha quota law was upheld in the Supreme Court, Mr. Patil said that the MAAS would be submitting a list of 15 demands to the CM and other senior Cabinet members. These include fee waiver for Maratha community students, an immediate stop to the mega-recruitment drive to fill vacant police posts until the issue was resolved in the SC, increased funding to the tune of ₹1,000 crore to rejuvenate Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute or SARTHI, and withdrawing police cases lodged against Maratha protesters. The Maratha Kranti Morcha — another umbrella outfit spearheading the quota agitation — has alleged that the phones of important leaders of the agitation was being tapped by the authorities. Rajendra Kondhare, convenor, Maratha Kranti Morcha, said: “Perhaps the police do such things as a matter of course, but Maratha community leaders have sensed that their phones were being tapped by the administration of both the erstwhile BJP government and the MVA government. If this has indeed been happening, then we urge the Home Department to immediately look into it and put a stop to this practice.” Mr. Kondhare warned that if this practice continued, then the Maratha agitation would be even more intense than that of the Patel or the Gujjar communities in the coming days. Mr. Kondhare also urged the OBC community to join in the fight to ensure that Maratha community members got their due rights. “The OBCs must take two steps forward. We must look for alternatives beyond political compromises.” On September 27, the Maratha Kranti Morcha has called for an ‘Aakrosh Morcha’ (anger-demonstration rally) in Pune to express its ire against all political parties and leaders in the district. “We will be surrounding offices of all major political parties while demonstrating outside the homes of all legislators and MPs of Pune, who have failed to fight for the rights for the Maratha community while using us as vote banks,” a Maratha Kranti Morcha representative said. Maratha community activists continued protests across the State on Wednesday, blocking roads and staging demonstrations in Sangli, Ahmednagar and Parbhani districts.

In her bail application filed before the Bombay High Court on Tuesday, actor Rhea Chakraborty, arrested in connection with a drugs case, has said that Sushant Singh Rajput was the only consumer of drugs and he used others around him to facilitate his habit.“The said documents clearly indicate that Sushant Sing Rajput was the only consumer of drugs and that he was directing his staff members, Samuel Miranda and Dipesh Sawant, to procure his drugs. Apart from that, the prosecution has made statements to the effect that applicant and her brother Showik are used by the late actor to procure drugs for himself,” she has said in her bail plea filed by her lawyer Satish Manshinde. Ms. Chakraborty, who is in Byculla jail after being arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), has said, “based on the information available in public domain, Neeraj, who worked as a cook for the late actor has stated to CBI and Mumbai police that three days before his death, Sushant Singh Rajput had asked him to make ganja joints/doobies and place them in his bedroom. Accordingly, Neeraj prepared the joints and kept them in a box in Sushant’s bedroom. When Sushant died, Neeraj checked and found the box to be empty.”The 28-year-old actor further said, “Therefore, it is clear from the evidence collected by the investigating agencies that it was only the late Sushant Singh Rajput who was the consumer of the drugs and who was in habit of using those around him to facilitate his drug habit.”The plea said, “She and her brother (Showik also in jail) are being targeted in a witch hunt and that Sushant Singh Rajput had told her that he developed a large liking for ganja sometime in 2015-16 during the shooting of Kedarnath.” She has sought the investigating agency to look into how the late actor used to manage his drug consumption through his staff hired by him and his sister Priyanka, prior to meeting her.

Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana of the Madras High Court on Wednesday reserved her verdict on a batch of new writ petitions filed by DMK president M.K. Stalin and 17 other MLAs challenging fresh show cause notices issued to them on September 7 in connection with the 2017 breach of privilege proceedings. The judge told Advocate General (A-G) Vijay Narayan and senior counsel R. Shunmugasundaram, N.R. Elango and Amit Anand Tiwari, representing the petitioners, that she shall pronounce interim orders on the batch on Thursday itself since that was the day fixed by the Committee of Privileges for the MLAs to submit their replies. During the course of arguments, when the judge expressed her mind that she was inclined to stay all further proceedings, the A-G opposed any such move and sought grant of short period of time for filing of a counter affidavit. He said nothing adverse would happen since the Committee of Privileges had no power to take any action against the MLAs. He said the committee’s recommendations had to be placed before the House and only after deliberations, any action would be initiated. “It is not as if the Assembly is going to assemble tomorrow or the day after and take action against the petitioners. Therefore, there is no need for any interim orders in favour of them,” he argued.

The government on Wednesday agreed to set up a House committee to probe alleged large-scale irregularities in implementation of the Ganga Kalyana Yojane meant to provide water facilities to poor Dalit farmers by sinking borewells.The announcement by Leader of the House and Muzrai Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary came after members, cutting across party lines, in the Legislative Council urged the government to probe the alleged irregularities after BJP member Y.A. Narayanswamy raised the issue, and pointed at various corrupt practices found across the State.“The discretionary quota of 20% of the total allocation of borewells is being grossly misused. Fake bills are being created where borewells were not even sunk, bills are being raised for wells where water could not be harvested, and there is huge corruption in allocation of borewells as money is being demanded from farmers,” Mr. Narayanswamy said, adding that 50% of the bills submitted were bogus. The discretionary quota is given to Ministers and board members of Dr. Ambedkar Development Corporation, Bhovi Development Corporation, and Adijambava Development Corporation, he added.According to the data provided, since 2015–16 as many as 31,735 borewells have been approved under the scheme and about ₹1,110 crore has been spent. “While the committee headed by legislators have to adhere to the KTCP Act and no 5G exemption is given, the 5G exemption is given to discretionary quota. This meant, there was no tendering and data shows that 5,831 borewells were sunk at the cost of ₹224 crore under the quota.” While 10,221 borewells identified by the committee is yet to be sunk, just about 600 borewells identified under the discretionary quota remains.

Opposition to the South Indian Mills Association’s (SIMA) plan to set up a textile processing park at Periyapattu in the district, is gaining momentum with the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board (TWAD) halting work on laying of pipelines due to stiff resistance from the locals.Over 10 textile companies under the aegis of SIMA have proposed to set up their processing units in the Phase III of the SIPCOT industrial park.Though the project was mooted way back in 2013 by SIMA, at an estimate of ₹600 crore, it has met with stiff opposition from the residents of Thyagavalli, Thiruchopuram, Andarmullipallam and Kayalpattu in Periyapattu panchayat.The move by the TWAD Board to lay pipelines for a distance of 18.5 km for the project ran into rough weather on September 21, after residents opposed the move strongly.The work was halted and the district administration elicited the views of the villagers, environmentalists and representatives of SIMA at a peace meeting chaired by Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri on Tuesday.A senior official said that the work had neither begun nor stopped. “We have elicited suggestions and objections raised by the villagers.

Ramanathan of SACEM said that the textile park would lead to severe pollution, resulting in irreparable damage to the environment.“Already, industries in SIPCOT Phase I and II were extracting groundwater indiscriminately through nine borewells sunk in the estate. While groundwater levels have severely depleted, SIPCOT has now proposed to supply water from Phases I and II to the units coming up in Phase III located at a distance of 10 km,” he said.S.

A rare surgery conducted on a 36-year-old man from Surat by doctors at a Mumbai hospital has put an end to severe breathing problems being faced by him for over eight years. In fact, these last two years have been particularly difficult as he had to move around with an oxygen cylinder.When Bhaveshbhai Sabhadia approached Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital (Sir HNRFH) for treatment, he was unable to walk more than a few steps at a time, was not getting sleep in the night and had been on and off hospitalisation due to water accumulation in the abdomen region. He had been told that the only way to save his life was a heart and lung transplant. However, doctors at Reliance conducted a rare curative surgical procedure instead of a heart-lung transplant as suggested by international and Indian experts.“The doctors evaluated his health condition and diagnosed him with chronic thrombus pulmonary embolism (CTPEH), a condition wherein the patient has high blood pressure in the lungs’ arteries. They also found that the right side of his heart was severely damaged and the blood pressure in the lung vessels was four times more than the normal,” said hospital officials.CTPEH is a rare and severe form of pulmonary hypertension (PH) which goes undiagnosed in most cases. In Mr. Sabhadia’s case too, it was diagnosed very late leading to severe damage to his heart.Dr. Anvay Mulay and his team of doctors at Sir HNRFH decided to go for pulmonary endarterectomy surgery instead of the heart-lung transplant.“Though it was a high risk and challenging surgery, doctors managed to remove the old blood clots from the pulmonary arteries in the lungs and reduce the blood pressure inside the arteries. Post the surgery, doctors were happy to see the right side of the heart responding well and showing remarkable improvement,” the hospital said in a statement.“In Mr. Sabhadia’s case, it was a level 3-4 CTPEH making it technically a difficult surgery. It was heartening to see a terminally ill patient, who was waiting for heart-lung transplant, walk home with his own organs,” said Dr. Mulay, director cardiac surgery and heart transplant, Sir HNRFH.Mr. Sabhadia, who works in a diamond unit in Surat, is out of danger and ready to lead a normal life. He had been suffering from this ailment since 2012 and the situation had aggravated in the recent past.

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday yet again criticised Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for the AIADMK extending support to the three Agriculture Bills passed in Parliament. He asked whether Mr. Palaniswami, who claimed to be a farmer, would apologise to the farmers if he did not find the words ‘Minimum Support Price’ (MSP) in the Bills. Mr. Stalin said the Chief Minister had lost the moral compass to call himself a farmer.“The farmers’ fight is at least to get MSP for their produce. But the AIADMK supported the Bills, which do not even have these three words (Minimum Support Price), in both Houses of Parliament and the Chief Minister is giving speeches supporting these Bills. Is he really a farmer? No. Why is he trying to portray himself as an innocent man?” Mr. Stalin asked.

With Panvel taluka receiving 306 mm rain, its second highest single-day rainfall of the year, the villages — Kombadbhuje, Dungi and Pargaon — adjoining the Navi Mumbai International Airport have been flooded. While Dungi and Pargaon are on the outskirts of the proposed airport, Kombadbhuje is one of the 10 villages acquired by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) to construct the airport. Some of the project affected persons who have not vacated the village yet, owing to non-fulfilment of demands by the CIDCO, are affected. The villagers claim that the land filling for the airport work had led to filling of the storm water drains which has caused the flooding of their houses.“Kombadbhuje never gets flooded to this level. The rain started by Tuesday night and by 3 a.m. on Wednesday, we had water level till window. Talathi office workers started pumping the water by around 8 a.m. but by evening, the water level remained same,” Bhushan Koli, a villager, said. Mr. Koli alleged chocking of the drainage pipes due to the land filling work for the airport. “We are now surrounded by water from all four sides and suffer heavy losses due to the flooding,” Mr. Koli said. Meanwhile, Dungi villagers who were termed as ‘non-eligible’ for compensation as per the criteria are still residing in the village and fighting for compensation with the CIDCO. Dungi village had started flooding in 2018 ever since the Ulwe river was diverted for the airport project. Dungi village was not part of the airport project and was not considered for compensation but due to the flooding, its villagers are now being rehabilitated. “We are still awaiting a final decision from the CIDCO on the issue of eligibility. How long can we keep waiting in this village which is now highly flood-prone?” asked Adesh Baik from Dungi village. Mr. Koli said their previous generation had given their lands in 1970s to the CIDCO and they are still awaiting their compensation as per the 12.5 % gaothan scheme. “We have not received our dues since 1970s and how can we now believe when this compensation would be done by the CIDCO?. Hence, we are not vacating the village till all our demands are met,” Mr. Koli said.Panvel tehsildar Amit Sanap said, “Since the villages are at low-lying areas, there is heavy flooding. We have installed pumps to drain out the water and the work is in progress.” Mr. Sanap refused to comment if the flooding has anything to do with the airport’s work. The CIDCO could not be reached for a comment.Nerul and Belapur in Navi Mumbai received the highest single-day rainfall of the year and have crossed 400 mm in the last 24 hours. The heavy rain led to flooding in many low-lying areas in Belapur. “The revenue department has started with the panchnama of the flooded areas to understand the losses,” the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation PRO said.

Madhya Pradesh Urban Development and Housing Minister Bhupendra Singh on Wednesday said “incorrect” information was provided by Agriculture Minister Kamal Patel before the Vidhan Sabha about farm loan waivers during the 15-month Congress regime in the State.Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Singh said: “Wrong information has been sent to the Vidhan Sabha. It will be inquired into and corrected.”Mr. Patel, during a single-day Assembly session on Monday, had made a written admission in reply to questions by former Congress Ministers Jaivardhan Singh and Bala Bachchan, stating that farm loans of nearly 27 lakh farmers had been waived since December 2018, effectively during the Congress government. The reply had embarrassed the BJP, which had often assailed the Congress claiming it had reneged on its election promise of waiving farm loans within 10 days of coming to power. In his replies the Agriculture Minister had stated that under the ‘Jai Kisan Crop Loan Waiver Scheme’, ₹7,10,896 lakh (₹7,108.96 crore) for 20,23,136 cases had been approved in the first phase before December 17 last year, while ₹4,53,802 lakh (₹4538.02 crore) had been approved for 6,72,245 cases in the second phase. ‘Truth has prevailed’Reacting to Mr. Patel’s admission in the Assembly, State Congress working president Jitu Patwari said, “Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has several times stated that the BJP toppled our government as we did not waive loans... Despite our clarifications with proof, their lies and hypocrisy didn’t stop. Now, the truth has prevailed, while the lies have been exposed.”Congress MP and former party president Rahul Gandhi tweeted: “Congress - it fulfilled what it promised. BJP - only false promises.” Earlier, several BJP leaders, including Jyotiraditya Scindia, had flagged the reported non-fulfilment of loan waivers, while Mr. Patel had described it as a “fraud”. Calling upon both Mr. Chouhan and Mr. Scindia to apologise to the public as they had “betrayed farmers”, former Chief Minister Kamal Nath said Mr. Patel’s admission affirmed his avowal of keeping the election promise. “After this admission, the government should immediately begin waiving loans of the remaining farmers,” he said. In his reply, Mr. Patel had pointed out that approval for 5,90,848 cases was pending. “A detailed review of the loan waiver scheme is under consideration by the government,” he had said.

As many as 66.1% of those worst affected in India during the Spanish Flu belonged to oppressed classes and suffered the consequences of multidimensional poverty. Similar trends persist today. The inability to adhere to public health protocols that prescribe distancing and use of hygienic products, the absence of private toilets and basic amenities, and the lack of adequate nutrition are all realities in lower- and middle-income countries. Amongst those most affected are homeless persons and the ultra-poor, many of whom are employed in the informal sector. They are exposed to greater adversity against the backdrop of intergenerational social disadvantage and lack of social security.Health shocks could precipitate a downward spiral into a state of not just homelessness, but also hopelessness. Globally, unpreparedness to handle the pandemic and near collapse of the health systems denudedour ability to focus on health. Many countries have attempted to make amends for the unjustifiable perpetuation of structural barriers and inequities. However, are we awakened to the needs of our poor only during a disaster? The pandemic has made a sound case for increased investments in the health and social sectors. States must also re-examine the role of social determinants of health in perpetuating unjust structures that normalise deprivation. A person’s social context and health intersect to help achieve a better quality of life. Relative poverty and its co-relation to stress, mental health and well-being have been evidenced. While distress cannot always be pathologised, data suggest that deaths by suicide and common mental disorders have also been on the rise during the pandemic.Also read | Cast off by outer and inner worldsDistinctly deprivedWithin this context, distinctly deprived are homeless persons living with a mental illness. They are at risk of violent victimisation, assault and long-term incarceration. In India, close to two million individuals sleep rough; 35% of them live with one or the other mental health concern.The presence of homeless persons with mental illness elicits a range of responses from a desire to help, triggered by evocation of pity or sympathy, to wilfully wishing them away or shunning them from mainstream society. Historically, in a limited context of religiosity associated with renunciation and hearing voices (considered unique to the saint), a few were deified; however, the majority were feared, found to be repulsive and often treated as objects of ridicule. This has resulted in their occupying a lowly place in society’s hierarchical structure even today.Pathways into homelessness include abject poverty, conflict, natural or man-made disasters, lack of access to health and mental health care, social hardships, disruptions in care-giving and domestic violence. In India, homeless persons with mental illness are also the largest number of long-stay patients in State mental hospitals. Besides a few exceptions, services for this under-served group are scarce globally. As they are susceptible to physical co-morbidities and co-occurring substance misuse, and unshielded against the consequences of homelessness, malnutrition, sexual violation, loss of support networks and kinship, homeless persons find their longevity impacted. Further, their experience of loneliness and hyper-segregation contributes to their low sense of self-worth and shrunken group identity, weakening their collective ability to influence change. Additionally, we unfortunately inherited a legacy of name-calling and large and unwieldy lunatic asylums and poor houses from the colonial era which got off to an altruistic start but were later ridden with inadequacies and often deployed as punitive measures to initiate ‘reform’. Inadequate care staff resulted in a grossly underwhelming caregiving climate. Fortunately, strong resistance has been built against parochial practices which are giving way to newer dimensions of therapeutic and social care. However, much remains to be done.Also read | A better life, a healthier mindA person-centric action planUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’s call to “step up for the vulnerable” cannot be more timely. The UN set up a fund of $2 billion to alleviate the distress of the ultra-vulnerable, including those living with disability or chronic illness. Along similar lines, the Tamil Nadu government, taking cognisance of the mental health needs of homeless persons, will take to scale Emergency Care and Recovery Centres (ECRC) that will support the treatment and community inclusion of this vulnerable section in 10 districts (in addition to the five districts where ECRCs were set up in 2018). The Department of Health, the National Health Mission, the Institute of Mental Health in Chennai, and The Banyan, a mental health care establishment, in partnership with multi-sectoral service providers, will together pursue the goal of improving mental health access and mitigating social and opportunity losses.Three hundred bed spaces will be earmarked for homeless persons in psychosocial distress, with a capacity to service more than 1,000 people a year, in smaller and integrated care units in district hospitals and/ or social care centres. Early enrolment into care may result in reduction of exposure to harm, injury and starvation, and better prognosis. An integrated approach may also help address stigma associated with this group. Additionally, facilitation of social needs care and livelihoods may reduce the recurrence of episodic homelessness, critical to sustaining and enhancing well-being gains. Three sectors — the government, development and corporate sectors — will partner to ensure that the lives of those who live on the fringes matter. The mental health team that anchors the Centre may also lend further support to the District Mental Health Programme, and offer counselling support to address mental health issues in the context of the pandemic.Comment | Inclusive ecosystems for mental healthHowever, we must remember that issues of homelessness and mental ill health even independently present intractable problems; in combination, one may confront ethical dilemmas and emerging constraints and challenges. We realise that the ECRCs are not a panacea to all distress undergone by homeless individuals, and that we cannot frame the problem within a restrictive and normative orientation. Incorporation of heterogeneity of experiences and multi-nodal approaches to care, which are embedded in values of accountability and integrity and take into account variegated distress markers, maybe critical for the evolution of newer meaning-making around social and psychiatric phenomenology. More importantly, these care paradigms have to be informed by the long overdue voice of the ‘subject in distress’. While this is a powerful start to acknowledge the need to focus on minority mental health, we also hope to benefit from feedback to further build on care plans and mental health systems for the vulnerable.Vandana Gopikumar is Co-founder, The Banyan and The Banyan Academy of Leadership in Mental Health, and J.

In 1943, Hannah Arendt began a narrative that had the potential to confer a sense of identify on millions of people who faced the misfortune of not only having lost a home, but also the impossibility of having to find a new one. She challenged the framework that made access to citizenship the sole prerogative of the state. Through this framework, the ideas of ethnical and racial homogeneity were propagated. This subsequently linked the idea of being a rights-bearing individual to the concept of citizenship. More specifically, the narrative of citizenship being the sole prerogative of the nation state linked the idea of a rights-bearing individual to the idea of belongingness to a particular formalised political community. Inclusion, a preconditionThe predicaments that such an idea brought with itself were acknowledged by Arendt, when she recognised the inefficacy of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. She said that in order to be entitled even to basic human rights, a person is required to be something more than just a human being. The person is required to be a member of a political community which can enforce her other civil, economic and political rights. Arendt emphasised on this right to inclusion in a political community which precedes even the most basic of human rights and phrased it as the “right to have rights”. This premise stemmed from the fact that a right without a corresponding remedy or means of enforcement is practically meaningless. Against this backdrop, she apprised the world of the plight of the stateless who have been denationalised or denaturalised, and whose very need for a validating community or the right of inclusion has inclusion as its precondition. Also read | 19 lakh NRC-excluded stuck in limboWith respect to India, this concept of being regarded as a rights-bearing individual only when one belongs to a particular formalised political community has become so well entrenched in the socio-legal ethos that hardly anyone has raised questions about its soundness in the last seven decades. This has been fundamentally because the assumptions about the access to citizenship have always seemed so settled that we have forgotten that such assumptions were once instituted through a narrative, and can be revised as such. No citizenship, no belongingThe exclusion of 19 lakh people from the National Register of Citizens in Assam stripped them not only of their citizenship, but also their bare status as human beings. They are left with no forum whatsoever to even assert their “right to have rights.” This is essentially because once the Foreigners Tribunal decides that an individual is a foreigner, she is sent to a detention camp where she is to be kept until she can be sent back to her country of origin.This is problematic as it reinforces Arendt’s argument that it is possible for humans to exist in a place called nowhere. This is due to the twin effects of the lack of a validating community which will accept these individuals (unless there is an agreement to the effect with the alleged country of origin) and the sheer impracticality of the rightless laying claim to a community from which they have been wilfully excluded. To add on to this, the flawed determination procedures of the Foreigners Tribunal have also ensured that such individuals are also precluded from the ostensible protection of a social order. Also read | Don’t send children excluded from Assam NRC to detention camps: Supreme CourtNatural rights theorists assert that basic rights should be available even if only a single human being remains on earth, but history demonstrates that resistance and political mobilisation are the first steps towards asserting such rights. This asymmetry is neither new nor unprecedented. It is just a constant reminder of the world order we live in, where the “rightlessness of the stateless is assumed, rather than asserted, let alone argued.”Tanishk Goyal is a student at the West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata.

Political alignments in Bihar for the forthcoming elections offer a peek into the various ways the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) constructs its electoral building blocks. Taking into consideration the specificities of each State, the NDA has been able to secure the votes of the upper castes as well as large sections of non-Yadav Other Backward Classes (OBCs), especially in large parts of north and central India. And due to its successes, prominent Dalit leaders are either aligning with it or going soft on it.Models in Bihar and Uttar PradeshIn Bihar, the Hindutva discourse is still not sufficient for the BJP to win votes, unlike in, say, Uttar Pradesh. If alliance-building in Bihar fails, the BJP also fails. This was seen in 2015 when Nitish Kumar of the Janata Dal (United) and Lalu Prasad of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) joined hands and defeated the BJP. The BJP’s model in Bihar is to build a strong alliance, where it is able to secure the support of many upper castes, Mr. Kumar is able to mobilise the Kurmis and other non-Yadav OBCs, and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan, a significant section of Dalits (the Dusadhs). In 2015, a coalition of the JD(U), the RJD and other parties successfully defeated the BJP. This time is different as the JD(U) walked out of that coalition in 2017.Comment | Nitish Kumar won’t have it easyPolitical developments in U.P. point to a different template. In U.P., unlike in Bihar, the BJP could fight back successfully against an attempted Dalit-OBC-Muslim alliance by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Following that defeat, BSP chief Mayawati broke her alliance with the SP. Since then, she has been soft on the Centre. She supported the Centre’s move on Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and also credited the Supreme Court for paving the way for construction of the Ram Mandir.How does one understand the BJP’s continued success in U.P.? Since the 1990s, the general sense was that caste combines could always defeat the ideology of Hindutva in U.P., as in Bihar. The reasoning was that caste is an expression of divergences, and if subaltern castes made common cause against ‘Brahmanical’ Hindutva, evoking the discourse of Bahujan (the majority), they would win.In 1993, the SP and the BSP defeated the BJP soon after the demolition of the Babri Masjid on the strength of the Bahujan discourse. However, that alliance came apart within two years. When the two parties came together again in 2019, the BJP defeated them on its own, securing the support of the upper castes and large sections of the OBCs and thus creating a new Bahujan, as it were. The non-Yadav OBCs felt that the Yadavs were reaping the fruits of social justice and wanted to vote for the BJP. The BJP seems to no longer need alliances in the State.Comment | The dominant caste dilemmaIn U.P., the BJP portrays the Muslims primarily, and then the Yadavs, as the ‘other’. In Haryana, the Jats, who are the dominant caste, are projected as the ‘other’. In Maharashtra, the Marathas are the ‘other’. The BJP is thus able to attract many upper castes, OBCs and even some Dalits.Impact on Dalit politicsThese models of largely upper caste-OBC alliances have propelled the BJP to great heights. They have also impacted Dalit politics. A prime driver of Dalit politics since the 1980s was the need for greater representation. Power, it was believed, was crucial for Dalit uplift as Dalits lacked the resources to be able to rise without representation.The sudden widening of the BJP’s social base under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has convinced established Dalit leaders that the BJP is here to stay. They believe that transacting with the party is now a necessity. In Bihar, Mr. Paswan has supported the BJP for some years now. Jitan Ram Manjhi, a symbol of non-Dusadh Dalit politics, also supports the party. In U.P., Ms. Mayawati has softened her approach towards the BJP. In 2019, Ramdas Athawale told Parliament that he supported the BJP as he had seen which way the wind was blowing. The message is thus clear: unless there is a serious challenge to the BJP at the Centre, Dalit leaders have to be open to supporting the BJP on many issues.Comment | The crisis in Dalit-Bahujan politicsThe belief that a Dalit-Muslim alliance can defeat the BJP is a romantic one held by some liberals. The fact is that prominent Dalit faces like Mr. Paswan are with the NDA today. And strident Dalit critics of the regime like Chandrashekhar Azad are electorally untested.Vikas Pathak teaches at Asian College of Journalism, Chennai

Patches of slushy ground, muddy tracks and coats of paint peeling off the roof, and cracks growing on walls. These are the sights that greet sports lovers in Guntur when they visit the Brahmananda Reddy Stadium, which has witnessed many memorable sporting achievements.A recent spell of heavy rains has only worsened the situation at the stadium, which remains out of bounds for athletes due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Several promises were made over the years by successive governments to renovate the stadium, but these have remained on paper. While massive sums have been allotted to building an indoor stadium and the administrative offices of Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP), the stadium, sadly, lies in throes of neglect.Glorious pastThe Brahamananda Reddy Stadium was the oldest stadium in the State under SAAP and was built in 1965 on 26.40 acres of land. The stadium has been a happy hunting ground for star athletes, and it was here in 1989 during the National Athletics Championship that P.T. Usha rediscovered her form, after the history she created in the Asian Games in 1984. The stadium also hosted first class Ranji matches in the 1980s and 90s.Since then, the stadium has lost its sheen over the last few years and has become a shadow of itself due to the apathy of sporting bodies.“BR Stadium still brings back good memories. We have been practising in the ground for the last 40 years. The government should rebuild the place and make it a multi-purpose stadium. Synthetic athletics tracks have come up at many places, but not in Guntur. Since the walls have started cracking, the stadium should be rebuilt,” Athletics Association of Guntur district secretary G. Seshaiah said.Scores of budding athletes continue to practice on the dusty track without proper equipment, while hockey players slug it out on an open space outside the stadium and gymnasts struggle in a make-shift room.An indoor stadium and an administrative block for SAAP were constructed at an amount of ₹8 crore. While the indoor stadium continues to serve its purpose, the SAAP shifted its offices to the IGMC Stadium in Vijayawada.The tennis court has been relaid but it has not been opened for the past one year. The indoor stadium for badminton is the lone exception.The stadium also does not have an adequate underground drainage system, making it vulnerable to inundation during heavy rain.

All cultivators at the grassroots level should compulsorily register their names online under the e-crop booking system to get all the benefits entitiled to them, according to State Agriculture Commissioner H. Arun KumarVisiting the rain-affected Basavanapalem village near Kodavalur along with Nellore Collector K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu, he said that only names of those tilling the land would be registered under the system. Without registering their names, the farmers would not be able to get minimum support price for their produce and other benefits including input subsidy for any crop loss, he said. Millers from West Godavari district were being pressed into service for expeditious milling, he said. The Collector assured the agitated growers that every grain produced by them would be procured at the farm level itself by offering minimum support price and asked them not to resort to distress sale. He wanted them to adopt better agronomic practices by taking suggestions from experts available at the Rythu Bharosa centres.Worried over excess moisture, farmers urged the State Government to bail them out by arranging for more paddy dryers. Those who took up cultivation of NLR3354 variety had suffered losses due to adverse climatic conditions, they lamented.

The threat of floods receded further with rains abating in the catchment areas of the Somasila reservoir on Wednesday.The inflow into the reservoir from the peak level of 1.48 lakh cusecs on Sunday, came down drastically to 25,972 by Wednesday evening as the Penna pacified. The flood situation improved further with the flow in the Penna and its tributary Kundu dipping drastically, Somasila Superintending Engineer N. Krishna Rao said while keeping a close vigil on the water flow.The entire water quantity was discharged from the reservoir downstream, including 11,500 cusecs to Kandaleru reservoir, to maintain a flood cushion of 4 tmcft of water in the reservoir which now had a storage of 73.86 tmcft of water against the maximum capacity of 78 tmcft of water. The storage in Kandaleru reservoir, which caters to the drinking water needs of Chennai and Tirupati, went up to a healthy 42.67 tmcft. The discharge was maintained at 1,810 cusecs. The reservoir still had a flood cushion of 25.36 tmcft of water, according to report compiled by the Irrigation Department.

TDP leaders on Wednesday submitted a memorandum to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Executive Officer demanding that the rule stipulating non-Hindus to sign a declaration before entering the Lord Venkateswara temple in Tirumala be applicable to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy as well.At a press conference here, former Minister Kalava Srinivasulu and Anantapur Urban MLA Vaikuntham Prabhakar Chowdhary alleged that the YSRCP government was hurting the sentiments of the Hindu community by remaining a silent spectator to incidents like desecraton of idols at Pithapuram, burning of the chariot at Antarvedi, and theft of silver lion idols at Vijayawada. “Let the Chief Minister give a statement that he would take all measures to ensure the sentiments of Hindus are not hurt through such incidents,” Mr. Srinivasulu said.The TDP Polit Buro member alleged that Hindus did not have faith in Mr. Jagan, and said that no such incident ever took place during the TDP regime as the party believed in secular politics.“From the time of taking oath as Chief Minister till entering the Tirumala temple, Mr. Jagan had been deviating from the traditions and hurting the sentiments of Hindus, he alleged, and said that people would give their verdict in the next elections based on these actions.Asked if the TDP was supporting the BJP in this agitation, Mr. Srinivasulu said that there was no political mileage being drawn out of these statements and asserted that the TDP would be the only alternative to YSRCP whenever elections are held.

The Opposition Congress and Janata Dal (S) on Wednesday staged a walkout in the Legislative Assembly after the government turned down its demand for a judicial probe into the alleged scam in purchase of equipment for COVID-19 management.Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar, who replied to a daylong debate on COVID-19 situation in the State, maintained that purchases had been made transparently. Terming the allegations of the Opposition as “false”, he said there was no need for any probe.Referring to instances of other States buying ventilators at cheaper prices, the Minister said there were different kinds of ventilators and their prices too varied. “The cheaper ones bought by Tamil Nadu and being referred to by the Opposition are the ones used for ambulances. But what Karnataka has procured are high-definition ventilators that have 54 specifications,” he claimed. He agreed to provide a break-up of statistics related to purchases.With respect to the allegations of the government paying ₹1,444 per PPE kit in April as against the charge of ₹575 paid for them in July, he said the prices were high earlier as the demand was also high. “If there was a scam, we would have paid higher prices even during July,” he maintained.He said 15 government departments had spent around ₹4,200 crore on things related to COVID-19. Of them, the Health and Family Welfare Department had procured equipment worth ₹1,142 crore while the Medical Education Department had spent ₹76 crore on procurements. Most of the purchases had been made through e-procurement, he said.Arguing that it would not be possible to follow all the procedures amid an emergency situation, he maintained that death toll would have touched one lakh if the authorities had waited for completion of various formalities before purchases. Urging the Opposition not to hit the morale of COVID warriors through allegations, he said no other State in the country had seen such allegations being levelled.Dr. Sudhakar also launched a counter-attack by alleging that erstwhile Congress-JD(S) coalition government had paid ₹21 lakh for purchase of ventilators as against ₹12 lakh to ₹18 lakh paid by the present dispensation.Walkout Not convinced by his reply, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah alleged that even a layman could understand there was something fishy in the purchase of COVID-19 equipment. “We cannot keep quiet,” he said and staged a walkout with all the Opposition members.

Parley in ParliamentIt is sad that the quality of parliamentary events is deteriorating with each session. It is true that the present BJP government enjoys a majority that bestows on it the right to decide on the course of governance and also bring in policy changes in the interest of the nation. However, the entire fulcrum of parliamentary democracy rests on the majesty of according a proportional share of opinion to the other political parties.The party in power has a larger responsibility vested in it to ensure that it makes sincere efforts to strive for political consensus and accommodation on major policies. Political and strategic differences may not pave the way for a smooth course, but that should not come in the way of attempting to transact governance, and by muting the Opposition. People expect a government with a majority and confident of its governance to display better valour in upholding parliamentary traditions.N. Sekar,Salem, Tamil Nadu The Opposition has all the rights to oppose and defend Bills, but not in a violent manner. There are ways and means to register its protest in a dignified manner. Given the short monsoon session, the Opposition should have debated the issues in an established way.Vaishnavi R. Patil,Kalaburgi, KarnatakaFCI’s grain preservationThe cartoon (OpEd page, September 22) conveys a very misleading picture about the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The FCI, as the central nodal agency responsible for the procurement, storage and distribution of foodgrains across India, does so maintaining the highest level of standards in maintenance and preservation. The cartoon gives the impression that the FCI’s preservation and maintenance of food grain stocks are of very low standards, leaving valuable foodgrains at the mercy of rodents. Damage of foodgrains in the FCI’s storage during 2020-21 (as on August 2020) was hardly 0.004% against the total quantity of 338 lakh metric tonnes foodgrains distributed by the FCI. Even this meagre quantity happened because of natural calamities such as floods, and not rodents.Despite the FCI’s voluminous operations and multi-level handling, the losses in storage are currently zero; the losses in transit, while transporting foodgrains across thousands of kilometres, from procuring centres to consuming centres, have also been very low during the past few years as a result of focused operations and scientific preservation techniques.In the pandemic period, the FCI has made foodgrains available to fair price shops not only under the Public Distribution System but also under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).The FCI has moved 9,637 rakes (train loads), transporting almost 270 LMT foodgrains (since March 2020), which is way higher than its operations in normal times.R.D.

What do Germany, Taiwan and New Zealand have in common? These are all countries that have women heading their governments. And although they are located in three different continents, the three countries seem to have managed the pandemic much better than their neighbours. Much along the same lines, a detailed recent study by researchers in the United States reports that States which have female governors had fewer COVID-19 related deaths, perhaps partly because female governors acted more decisively by issuing earlier stay-at-home orders. The authors of the study conclude that women leaders are more effective than their male counterparts in times of crises. There will be several critics (no need to guess their gender) who will question the reliability of this conclusion by pointing out deficiencies in the data — admittedly somewhat limited — or the econometric rigour of the analysis. Many will also point out that it is dangerous to make sweeping generalisations based on one study.The point about the danger of making sweeping generalisations is valid. Of course, studies such as these do not establish the superiority of all female leaders over their male counterparts. All female leaders are not necessarily efficient, and there are many men who have proved to be most effective and charismatic leaders. The important takeaway from the recent experience and such studies is the necessity of getting rid of inherent biases and perceptions about female effectiveness in leadership roles.Also read | Leadership starts the day you are born, Kamala Harris tells South Asian womenIndia’s gram panchayatsImportantly, female leaders also bring something quite different to the table. In particular, they perform significantly better than men in implementing policies that promote the interests of women. This was demonstrated in another study conducted by Nobel Laureate Esther Duflo and co-author Raghabendra Chattopadhyay, who used the system of mandated reservations of pradhans in gram panchayats to test the effectiveness of female leadership. Their study was made possible by the 1993 amendment of the Indian Constitution, which mandated that all States had to reserve one-third of all positions of pradhan for women. Since villages chosen for the mandated reservations were randomly selected, subsequent differences in investment decisions made by gram panchayats could be attributed to the differences in gender of the pradhans. Chattopadhyay and Duflo concluded that pradhans invested more in rural infrastructure that served better the needs of their own gender. For instance, women pradhans were more likely to invest in providing easy access to drinking water since the collection of drinking water is primarily, if not solely, the responsibility of women.In addition to the instrumental importance of promoting more space for women in public policy, this is also an important goal from the perspective of gender equality. The right to vote is arguably the most important dimension of participation in public life. There are others. What proportion of women stand for election to the various State and central legislatures? How many are elected? Perhaps more important, how many women occupy important positions in the executive branch of government?Also read | ‘Need more women in politics and conflict resolution’About suffrageIndependent India can rightly be proud of its achievement in so far as women’s suffrage is concerned. Women were allowed to vote from 1950 onwards and so could participate on an equal footing with men from the first general election of 1951-52. This is in striking contrast to the experience in the so-called “mature democracies” of western Europe and the United States. In the U.S., it took several decades of struggle before women were allowed to vote in 1920. Most countries in Europe also achieved universal suffrage during the inter-war period. Since most able- bodied men went away to the battlefields during the First World War, increasing numbers of women had the opportunity to show that they were adequate substitutes in activities that were earlier the sole preserve of men. This, it is suggested, mitigated the anti-female bias and earned women the right to vote in European countries.We have had and have charismatic female leaders like Indira Gandhi, Jayalalitha, Mayawati, Sushma Swaraj and Mamata Banerjee among several others. Interestingly, a glaring example of gender stereotyping was the labelling of Indira Gandhi as the “only man in the cabinet”. Apart from these stalwarts, the overall figures are depressing. The female representation in the current National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre is probably not very far from the typical gender composition in Indian central and State governments. Female members make up only about 10% of the total ministerial strength. The underrepresentation of female Ministers in India is also reflected in the fact that Ms. Banerjee is currently the only female Chief Minister.Comment | Strong is as strong doesThe underrepresentation of women in Indian legislatures is even more striking. For instance, the 2019 election sent the largest number of women to the Lok Sabha. Despite this, women constitute just over 14% of the total strength of the Lok Sabha. This gives us the dismal rank of 143 out of 192 countries for which data are reported by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Tiny Rwanda comes out on top with a staggering 60% of seats in its lower house occupied by women.The women’s Bill languishesSince women running for elections face numerous challenges, it is essential to create a level-playing field through appropriate legal measures. The establishment of quotas for women is an obvious answer. I have mentioned earlier that mandated reservation for women in gram panchayats was established in all major States since the mid-1990s. Attempts have also been made to extend quotas for women in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies through a Women’s Reservation Bill. Unfortunately, the fate of this Bill represents a blot on the functioning of the Indian Parliament. The Bill was first presented to the Lok Sabha by the H.D. Deve Gowda government in 1996. Male members from several parties opposed the Bill on various pretexts. Subsequently, both the NDA and United Progressive Alliance governments have reintroduced the Bill in successive Parliaments, but without any success. Although the Rajya Sabha did pass the bill in 2010, the Lok Sabha and the State legislatures are yet to give their approval — despite the 24 years that have passed since it was first presented in the Lok Sabha.

 Steps to reducing prejudiceOf course, there is a simple fix to the problem. The major party constituents of the NDA and UPA alliances can sidestep the logjam in Parliament by reserving say a third of party nominations for women. This will surely result in increasing numbers of women in legislatures and subsequently in cabinets. The importance of this cannot be overestimated. There is substantial evidence showing that increased female representation in policy making goes a long way in improving perceptions about female effectiveness in leadership roles. This decreases the bias among voters against women candidates, and results in a subsequent increase in the percentage of female politicians contesting and winning elections. So, such quotas have both a short-term and long-term impact. Indeed, voter perceptions about the efficacy of female leadership may change so drastically in the long run that quotas may no longer be necessary!Bhaskar Dutta is Professor, Ashoka University.

The United Nations has declared September 15 ‘International Day of Democracy’. An entry on its website states that this “provides an opportunity to review the state of democracy in the world”. To review the state of democracy in India would be timely given the times we are living through. Indeed by now, as India meets fresh challenges almost daily, for us to do so is arguably more important than to celebrate independence from colonial rule, which we do out of habit annually. But to review the state of democracy in India we would need to adopt a suitable criteria. A partial evaluationFormally, India is a democracy alright. There are multi-party elections with universal suffrage subject only to an age restriction. In evaluations of democracy in India it is often observed, to its credit, that it is the world’s largest democracy. Further plaudits are given for the smooth changeover in government after elections, the existence of an independent press and judiciary, and the guarantee of civil liberties justiciable in courts of law. While these are valid observations, the assessment is based on a partial evaluation. To an extent it amounts to admiring a form of government for its own sake without concern for the socioeconomic outcomes that are produced. It is like admiring the architecture of a building without pausing to enquire whether its inhabitants are happy to be living in it. Data | How has the state of democracy in India changed since 2008?Outcomes differ among countries that are democracies. Take for instance the life satisfaction that citizens report. First, it should be noted that this is potentially an important metric as it is based on people’s perceptions on what matters most, including the responsiveness of the government to their needs. In the UN’s World Happiness Report for 2020, the list of top 10 countries is heavily loaded with the democracies of western Europe. The U.S. barely edges into the top 20. India, on the other hand, is ranked 144 out of the 153 countries evaluated.Further, its ranking has dropped in recent years. We should be giving serious thought to both the fact of India’s low ranking on the happiness index and its slide. To my mind, the criterion that in a democracy the people must be satisfied with their life is given very little thought these days. It was not so in the early days of our republic. Built by the peopleTwo leaders who had recognised this criterion in their engagements with the public were Jawaharlal Nehru and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. Nehru was explicit in his speech on August 15, 1947 when he stated that the goal of independence was to create institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman. Note that Nehru had not promised that the government will create these institutions. He was far too aware that democracy is not synonymous with statism; it is about the people. Ultimately, the institutions that enable persons to lead fulfilling lives are built by the people themselves. Let me give you three examples, all from the United States. In the 1960s, that country saw movements for black empowerment, women’s emancipation and sexual liberation. These movements were remarkably successful in the outcomes they achieved, while receiving no support from the U.S. state. This is the sense in which it may be said that it is the people who build the institutions that matter. That said, however, the state has a role in their building. Laws must not constrain liberty when it is self-affirming and must change when it is realised that they do. Also read | India drops 10 ranks to 51st position in Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index On developmentThe role of the state does not end with removing restraints though. It extends to the endowment of individuals with capabilities in the sense of Amartya Sen. Prof. Sen had thought of capabilities as the endowments that allow individuals to undertake the functionings, or do the things, that they value. We can think of a person’s health and education as among the most important inputs into the capabilities that they end up possessing. While radical approaches to empowerment rightly emphasise the importance of self-help, it is not sufficiently recognised that individuals cannot easily equip themselves with capabilities, requiring the state to intervene. Think of a person born into poverty or a woman born into wealth but into a world with social sanction against education for women. Similarly, historically, the caste system in India had excluded a large section from education. While private initiative should not be de-legitimised, it has had only a limited impact on building capabilities in India as it has focused on those with the ability to pay. In a move to measure the capabilities of a population, the UN devised the Human Development Index. The main elements of this are health and education. As with the UN’s Happiness Index, India fares very poorly in the UN’s Human Development Index too. In 2019, India ranked 129th out of 189 countries. Judged in terms of human development — and one would be hard put to defend any other sense in which development is to be understood — Indian democracy is severely challenged. Also read | Freedom in the World 2020 report ranks India among least free democraciesPointing to the incongruence between India’s low level of human development and its status as a democracy evokes the response that this is to see the latter in instrumental terms. Democracy it is asserted is a form of government, namely government by discussion. The answer to this deflection is that democracy may be a form of government but surely the people have come to adopt this particular form of government with a goal in mind. We may safely assume a fulfilling life is that goal. Authoritarianism is not compatible with such a life, only  democracy, which at least in principle grants individuals a voice in governance, is.  Second, people adopt democracy so that they can participate in their own governance. They cannot but have foreseen that they must be endowed with capabilities if this is to be possible at all. Thus, liberty and capability are conjoined as the ultimate aspiration in a democracy.Comment | A ‘democracy capture’Neglect and repressionIn India, the state’s ritualistic attachment with the procedures of democracy has not been matched by an awareness of its implicit goal of a fulfilling life for Indians. By the 1950s, freedom of speech had been restricted by the First Amendment to the Constitution and the Directive Principles, that had enjoined upon the state to promote health and education, had been all but forgotten. Inevitably, the consequential underinvestment in a public health system has left the country severely unprepared for the emergency when COVID-19 struck. After reading of bodies left lying in their wards, we now read of an emerging shortage of something so basic as oxygen supply in metropolitan hospitals. COVID-19 affects the human respiratory system and oxygen is vital to avert the loss of life. Those who have survived thus far live with foreboding of a gruesome end. Not only has the state neglected its responsibility but it has resorted to repression when its inaction is questioned. Recently, an agency reported that a representative of the State in southern Andhra Pradesh publicly threatened with arrest a government doctor who had dared to mention at a review meeting that there were not enough beds in the primary health centre that he was responsible for.
